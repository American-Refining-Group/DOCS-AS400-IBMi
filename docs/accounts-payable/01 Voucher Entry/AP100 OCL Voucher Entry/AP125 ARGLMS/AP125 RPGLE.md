The `AP125.rpg` program is an RPG III program running on an IBM AS/400 (iSeries) system, designed to create voucher transactions from freight invoice data, likely called from the `AP125.ocl36.txt` OCL script after the `AP125P` program has selected invoices for batch processing. It processes freight invoice headers (`FRCINH` or `FRCFBH`) to generate accounts payable transactions in the `APTRAN` file, including header and detail records. Below, I will detail the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called, based on the provided source code.

### **Process Steps of the AP125 Program**

The program is structured to process freight invoices, validate data, calculate due dates, and create or update accounts payable transactions. The main process steps are:

1. **Initialization**:
   - **Parameters**: Receives input parameters:
     - `CO`: Company code (2 digits).
     - `CAID`: Carrier ID (6 characters).
     - `CAIN`: Invoice number (25 characters).
     - `RCD`: Record type (`FRCFBHP4` for freight billed balance header, otherwise `FRCINHP4`, per revision `JB06`).
     - `RDNO`: Reference number (numeric, defined like `FRRDNO`).
   - Initializes fields and indicators, setting indicators 81-83, 50-53, 60-69, and 51-62 to off.
   - Sets up key fields for file access (e.g., `TERMKY` for `APTERM`, `BBCAKY` for `BBCAID`).

2. **Subroutine S1 (Main Processing)**:
   - **Validate Company**: Chains to `APCONT` using `CO` to retrieve company details (e.g., `ACAPGL`, `ACCAGL`, `ACRTGL`, `ACNXTE`). If not found, sets indicator 50.
   - **Retrieve Invoice Data**:
     - Constructs a key (`FRCKEY` or `FRCK39`) using `CO`, `CAID`, `CAIN`, and `RDNO` (for `FRCFBH`).
     - Chains to `FRCINH` (if `RCD â‰  'FRCFBHP4'`) or `FRCFBH` (if `RCD = 'FRCFBHP4'`, per `JB06`) to retrieve invoice details.
     - If found, populates transaction fields:
       - `ATINV#`: Invoice number (`FRCAIN`).
       - `INTY`: Invoice type (`FRINTY`).
       - `ATINDT`/`INDT`: Invoice date (`FRIYMD` converted to MMDDYY).
       - `ATIAMT`/`IAMT`/`ATFRTL`/`FRTL`: Invoice amount (`FRINAM - FRFBOA`, per `JB06`).
       - `ATSORN`/`SORN`: Sales order number (`FRRDNO`).
       - `ATSSRN`/`SSRN`: Sales sequence number (`FRSRN`).
       - Sets indicators 51 (`INTY = 'P'`) or 52 (`INTY = 'O'`) for invoice description.
   - **Generate Entry Number**:
     - If `ENT#` is zero, sets `RECSTS = 'ADDNEW'`, retrieves the next entry number (`ACNXTE`) from `APCONT`, increments it, and updates `APCONT`.
     - Ensures `ENT#` does not exceed 99999, adjusting `ACNXTE` accordingly.
   - **Retrieve Vendor Information**:
     - Chains to `APVENY` using `CO` and `CAID` to get the vendor number (`VYVEND`).
     - Chains to `APVEND` using `CO` and `VEND` to retrieve vendor details (`VNVNAM`, `VNAD1`, `VNAD2`, `VNAD3`, `VNAD4`, `VNHOLD`, `VNSNGL`, `VNTERM`, `VNEXGL`).
     - Sets hold description (`HLDD`) based on `VNHOLD` (per `JB02` and `MG18`):
       - `H`: "VENDOR ON HOLD" (COM,01).
       - `A`: "ON HOLD FOR ACH" (COM,02).
       - `W`: "ON HOLD FOR WIRE TRANSFER" (COM,03).
       - `U`: "ON HOLD FOR UTILITY AUTO-PAYMENT" (COM,04).
   - **Output**: Writes or updates the transaction header in `APTRAN` via the `EXCPT` operation.

3. **Subroutine S2 (Header Processing and Detail Setup)**:
   - Chains to `APTRAN` using `KEYENT` (constructed from `COENT` and "000") to check for an existing header.
   - If not found, populates header fields from `APCONT` (`APGL`, `BKGL`, `RTGL`) and vendor data.
   - Calls `S2EDIT` to validate header fields.
   - Calls `HDRADD` to write/update the transaction header.
   - Calls `ROLFWD` to initiate detail line processing.
   - Sets indicator 81 to trigger further processing.

4. **Subroutine S2EDIT (Header Validation)**:
   - **Validate Invoice Date**:
     - Moves `INDT` to `MMDDYY` and calls `DTEDIT` to validate the date.
   - **Calculate Due Date**:
     - If `DUDT` is zero and `VEND` is non-zero, calls `CLCDUE` to calculate the due date based on vendor terms (`VNTERM`).
     - Otherwise, sets `DUDT = INDT`.
   - **Validate Due Date**:
     - Converts `DUDT` to `MMDDYY` and validates via `DTEDIT`.
     - Adjusts for century (`Y2KCEN`) to create `INDT8` and `DUDT8` (8-digit dates).
     - Checks `APDATE` (per `MG17`) to replace `DUDT8` with a non-holiday/non-weekend date (`ADNED8`).
   - **Validate G/L Accounts**:
     - Chains to `GLMAST` to validate `APGL`, `BKGL`, and `RTGL`, retrieving descriptions (`APGLNM`, `BKGLNM`, `RTGLNM`). Sets indicators 61, 62, or 63 if invalid.

5. **Subroutine CLCDUE (Calculate Due Date)**:
   - If `VNTERM` is non-zero, chains to `GSTABL` (table `APTERM`) to retrieve terms (`TBNETD`, `TBPRXD`, `TBDISC`, `TBDISD`).

8. **Subroutine DTEDIT (Date Validation)**:
   - Validates `MMDDYY` by breaking it into month, day, and year.
   - Checks:
     - Month (1-12).

    - Calls `AP1012` to populate freight detail lines with calculated percentage amounts.
    - Resets `RECSTS` and sets `KEYENT` to "001" for the first detail line.

12. **Subroutine S3 (Detail Line Processing)**:
    - If `FRTL` and `PRAM` are non-zero, calculates the freight amount (`FRAM = PRAM * FRTL`) and adds it to `HOLDAM` and `SVTTL`.
    - Adjusts `FRAM` if `IAMT > SVTTL` to balance the invoice amount.
    - Combines `PRAM` and `FRAM` to set `AMT`.
    - If `AMT` is zero, clears the header (`HDRCLR`) and exits.

   - Adjusts invoice amount (`ATIAMT = FRINAM - FRFBOA`, per `JB06`) to account for freight balancing order override total.

2. **Hold Status**:
   - Supports hold codes (`VNHOLD`): `H` (hold), `A` (ACH), `W` (wire transfer), `U` (utility auto-payment, per `MG18`).
   - Assigns corresponding descriptions to `HLDD` (per `JB02`, `MG18`).

3. **Due Date Calculation**:
   - Calculates due date (`DUDT`) based on vendor terms (`VNTERM`) using net days (`TBNETD`) or prox days (`TBPRXD`) from `GSTABL`.

   - Defaults to invoice date (`INDT`) if no terms are specified.

4. **Discount Handling**:
   - Retrieves discount percentage (`TBDISC`) from `GSTABL` and applies it to `SVDSPC` (per `MG03`).

5. **Date Validation**:
   - Validates invoice and due dates for valid months, days, and leap years.
   - Handles century adjustments for Y2K compliance.

6. **G/L Account Validation**:
   - Validates accounts payable (`APGL`), bank (`BKGL`), and retention (`RTGL`) G/L accounts against `GLMAST`.

7. **Detail Line Calculation**:
   - Calculates freight amount (`FRAM`) as a proportion of `PRAM` and `FRTL`.
   - Ensures total line amount (`AMT = PRAM + FRAM`) aligns with the invoice amount (`IAMT`).

8. **Freight Detail Lines**:
   - Calls `AP1012` to populate detail lines with calculated freight percentages, using sales order (`SORN`), sequence number (`SSRN`), and invoice date minus one year (`CMPDT8`, per `JB05`).

9. **Transaction Creation**:
   - Creates header and detail records in `APTRAN` with vendor, G/L, and freight details.
   - Updates `FRCINH` or `FRCFBH` to mark invoices as processed (`FRAPST = 'Y'`).

### **Summary**

The `AP125.rpg` program processes freight invoices from `FRCINH` or `FRCFBH` to create accounts payable transactions in `APTRAN`. It validates company, vendor, and G/L data, calculates due dates (adjusted for holidays/weekends), applies discounts, and generates header and detail records. The program handles freight balancing adjustments, hold statuses, and detail line calculations via `AP1012`. It ensures data integrity through extensive validation and updates the source invoice records upon completion.
