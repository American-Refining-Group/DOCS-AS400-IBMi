The provided document, `AP791.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG/36 program (used in IBM System/36 or AS/400 environments) called from the OCL program `AP791.ocl36.txt`. This program processes and prints a 1099 file for IRS reporting, handling data from the `IRSTAX` file, outputting to the `PA1099` file, and generating a printed report. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AP791 RPG Program

The RPG program follows a structured flow to read, process, and output 1099-related data. Here’s a breakdown of the process steps based on the RPG/36 code:

1. **File Definitions** (Lines 0005-0006):
   - **Input File (`IRSTAX`)**: Defined as a primary input file (`IP`) with a record length of 750 bytes. It contains 1099 data, including transmitter "T" records and payee "B" records. Multiple commented-out definitions suggest possible variations (e.g., `IRSTAXSOIS` or a 864-byte version), but only the 750-byte `IRSTAX` is active.
   - **Output File (`PA1099`)**: Defined as an output file (`O`) with a record length of 875 bytes, used to store processed 1099 data.
   - **Printer File (`PRINT`)**: Defined as a printer output file (`O`) with a record length of 164 bytes, used to generate a formatted 1099 report.

2. **Input Specifications** (Lines 0007-0122):
   - The program reads records from `IRSTAX` and identifies them by a record type (`A1REC`) at position 1:
     - **Transmitter "T" Record** (Line 0007, `NS 01`): Identified by `A1REC = 'T'`, processed differently from payee records.
     - **Payee "B" Record** (Line 0007, `NS 02`): Default record type for payee data, processed for 1099 reporting.
   - Fields are mapped from the `IRSTAX` file, including:
     - Payment year (`A1YR`, positions 2-5)
     - Taxpayer ID number (`A1TIN#`, positions 12-20)
     - Type of TIN (`A1TTIN`, position 11, `1` for EIN, `2` for SSN)
     - Payment amounts (`A1PAY1` to `A1PAYC`, positions 55-198, for various payment types)
     - Payee details (name, address, city, state, zip, etc.)
     - Tax withholding (`A1SITW` for state, `A1LITW` for local)
     - Other indicators (e.g., `A1FCI` for foreign country, `A1DSI` for direct sales).

3. **Calculation Specifications** (Lines 0194-0206):
   - **Record Processing**:
     - For "T" records (`NS 01`):
       - The program skips processing and jumps to the `END` tag (Line 0206), bypassing payee calculations.
     - For "B" records (`NS 02`):
       - Increments a record counter (`REC#`) and a count (`COUNT`) for tracking (Line 0194, 0199).
       - Accumulates non-zero payment amounts (`A1PAY1`, `A1PAY2`, `A1PAY3`, `A1PAY7`) into totals (`TPAY1`, `TPAY2`, `TPAY3`, `TPAY7`) and a combined total (`DPAY`) (Lines 0199-0200).
       - Checks the TIN type (`A1TTIN` = `1` for EIN or `2` for SSN) to set indicators `21` or `22` (Lines 0203-0204).
       - Writes the processed record to the `PA1099` file via the `IN` exception output (Line 0205).
   - **Commented-Out Logic**:
     - Some conditional checks (e.g., `A1PYES IFNE 'PA'`) and additional accumulations (`NPAY1`, `NPAY2`, `NPAY7`) are commented out, suggesting they were used in prior versions or for specific cases (e.g., filtering by state or additional totals).

4. **Output Specifications** (Lines 0207-0251):
   - **Printer Output (`PRINT`)**:
     - **Header Records** (Lines 0207-0231):
       - Prints headers for the report, including:
         - Company name (“AMERICAN REFINING GROUP, INC”).
         - Program name (“AP791”) and report title (“A/P 1099 FILE”).
         - Page number (`PAGE`) and date (`UDATE`).
         - Column headers for record number, TIN type, name control, SSN/EIN, payment amounts, name, address, city, state, and zip.
       - Headers are printed at the start of the report (`1P`) or on overflow (`OF`).
     - **Detail Lines** (Lines 0232-0251, `E IN`):
       - For each payee record, prints:
         - Record number (`REC#`).
         - TIN type (`A1TTIN`) and name control (`A1NCTL`).
         - Formatted TIN (`A1ID21`, `A1ID22`, etc., with hyphens for readability).
         - Payment amounts (`A1PAY1M`, `A1PAY2M`, `A1PAY3M`).
         - Payee details (name, address, city, state, zip).
     - **Total Lines** (Line 0232, `E TOTL`):
       - Prints accumulated totals for `TPAY1`, `TPAY2`, `TPAY7` at the end of the report.
   - **File Output (`PA1099`)** (Lines 0232-0251, `EADD IN`):
     - Writes records to the `PA1099` file with:
       - Hard-coded values (e.g., `222318612` for payer TIN, `001` for sequence).
       - Payment year (`A1YR`), TIN (`A1TIN#`), vendor number (`A1VEND`), and payee details.
       - Payment amounts (`A1PAY1`, `A1PAY2`, `A1PAY3`, `A1PAY7`, `A1SITW`).
       - Company details (“AMERICAN REFINING GROUP, INC”, address, etc.).
       - Combined payment total (`DPAY`).

5. **End of Program**:
   - After processing all records, the program writes final totals to the printer (`EXCPTTOTL`) and terminates at the `END` tag (Line 0206).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules for 1099 processing:
1. **Record Type Handling**:
   - Skips “T” (Transmitter) records, as they are not relevant for payee reporting.
   - Processes “B” (Payee) records for 1099 data.

2. **Payment Accumulation**:
   - Only non-zero payment amounts (`A1PAY1`, `A1PAY2`, `A1PAY3`, `A1PAY7`) are added to running totals (`TPAY1`, `TPAY2`, `TPAY3`, `TPAY7`) and a combined total (`DPAY`).
   - These payments likely correspond to specific 1099 categories (e.g., non-employee compensation, rents, royalties).

3. **TIN Formatting**:
   - TINs are identified as EIN (`A1TTIN = '1'`) or SSN (`A1TTIN = '2'`) and formatted accordingly (e.g., `XXX-XXXXXX` for EIN, `XXX-XX-XXXX` for SSN) for the printed report.

4. **Payee Filtering**:
   - Commented-out logic suggests a prior rule to filter records where the state (`A1PYES`) is not “PA” (Pennsylvania), but this is not active in the current version.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The `PA1099` file includes fixed payer details (e.g., TIN `222318612`, address “77 NORTH KENDALL AVENUE, BRADFORD, PA 16701”) and payee-specific data.
   - The printed report formats TINs with hyphens for readability and aligns payment amounts and payee details in columns.

6. **IRS Compliance**:
   - The program structures data in the `PA1099` file to meet IRS 1099 reporting requirements, including payment amounts, withholding, and payee information (name, address, TIN).

### Tables/Files Used

1. **IRSTAX**:
   - Type: Input (`IP`)
   - Record Length: 750 bytes
   - Description: Primary input file containing 1099 data, including transmitter (“T”) and payee (“B”) records. Fields include payment year, TIN, payment amounts, and payee details.

2. **PA1099**:
   - Type: Output (`O`)
   - Record Length: 875 bytes
   - Description: Output file storing processed 1099 data for IRS submission, including payer and payee details, payment amounts, and withholding.

3. **PRINT**:
   - Type: Printer Output (`O`)
   - Record Length: 164 bytes
   - Description: Printer file for generating a formatted 1099 report with headers, detail lines, and totals.

### External Programs Called

- **None**: The RPG program does not explicitly call any external programs. The `GSY2K` program referenced in the OCL program is executed before `AP791` is loaded, so it is not called from within the RPG code.

### Additional Notes

- **Commented-Out Code**: The presence of commented-out definitions (e.g., `IRSTAXSOIS`, alternate `IRSTAX` lengths) and logic (e.g., state filtering, additional totals) suggests the program was adapted over time or supports multiple configurations. These could be re-enabled for specific requirements.
- **TIN Formatting**: The program formats TINs differently for EIN and SSN, ensuring compliance with IRS reporting standards.
- **Hard-Coded Values**: The `PA1099` output includes fixed payer details (e.g., TIN `222318612`, address), indicating the program is tailored for “AMERICAN REFINING GROUP, INC.”
- **Environment**: The program is designed for the System/36 or AS/400, using RPG/36 syntax and OCL for job control.
