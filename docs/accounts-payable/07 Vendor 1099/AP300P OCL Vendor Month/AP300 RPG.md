The provided RPG program, `AP300.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG II program designed for the IBM System/36 environment, called by the OCL script `AP300.ocl36.txt`. It performs the actual clearing of Month-to-Date (MTD) and Year-to-Date (YTD) totals in the Accounts Payable (A/P) vendor master file. This program is the final step in the A/P update process orchestrated by `AP300P.ocl36.txt`, `AP300P.rpg36.txt`, and `AP300.ocl36.txt`. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables (files) used, and external programs called, ensuring a concise and clear analysis that integrates with the previous documents.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

The `AP300` program processes the sorted vendor records to clear MTD and optionally YTD totals in the vendor master file. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **File and Data Definitions**:
   - **Files**:
     - `APVEND`: Vendor master file, defined as an update file (`UP`) with 579-byte records, indexed (`I`), used for reading and updating vendor records.
     - `AP300S`: Sorted input file, defined as an input file (`IR`) with 30-byte records, indexed with 3-byte keys (`3IT`), used to identify which vendor records to update.
   - **Input Specifications**:
     - `APVEND` fields (packed decimal, `P`):
       - `VN$YTD` (6,2): YTD purchases (positions 195–200).
       - `VN$LYR` (6,2): Last year’s purchases (positions 201–206).
       - `VNDMTD` (4,2): MTD discounts (positions 207–210).
       - `VNDYTD` (5,2): YTD discounts (positions 211–215).
       - `VNPBAL` (5,2): Previous balance (positions 220–224).
       - `VNPURC` (5,2): MTD purchases (positions 225–229).
       - `VNPAY` (5,2): MTD payments (positions 230–234).
       - `VNCBAL` (5,2): Current balance (positions 235–239).
       - `VNTYDP` (6,2): This year’s YTD paid (positions 242–247).
       - `VNLYDP` (6,2): Last year’s YTD paid (positions 248–253).
     - `UDS` (Local Data Area):
       - `KYYTDY` (1 byte, position 135): Flag indicating whether to clear YTD totals (`'Y'` or blank).
   - **Indicators**:
     - `05`: Controls whether the program runs (set if `KYYTDY ≠ 'Y'`).
     - `50`: Set if YTD clearing is requested (`KYYTDY = 'Y'`).
     - `01`: Output indicator for updating `APVEND` records.

2. **Initialization and YTD Check (Lines 0026–0027)**:
   - Checks if `KYYTDY = 'Y'` (from `AP300P.rpg36.txt` via the Local Data Area).
   - If true, sets indicator `50` to control YTD field updates.
   - If `KYYTDY ≠ 'Y'`, sets indicator `05` to ensure the program processes MTD updates (line 0027).

3. **MTD Field Updates (Lines 0029–0032)**:
   - For each vendor record processed:
     - Clears `VNDMTD` (MTD discounts) to 0 (`Z-ADD0`).
     - Sets `VNPBAL` (previous balance) to the value of `VNCBAL` (current balance), preserving the balance before clearing MTD fields.
     - Clears `VNPURC` (MTD purchases) to 0.
     - Clears `VNPAY` (MTD payments) to 0.
   - These updates apply to all records processed, regardless of `KYYTDY`.

4. **YTD Field Updates (Lines 0034–0038)**:
   - If indicator `50` is on (`KYYTDY = 'Y'`):
     - Moves `VN$YTD` (YTD purchases) to `VN$LYR` (last year’s purchases), preserving YTD data before clearing.
     - Clears `VNDYTD` (YTD discounts) to 0.
     - Clears `VN$YTD` (YTD purchases) to 0.
     - Moves `VNTYDP` (this year’s YTD paid) to `VNLYDP` (last year’s YTD paid), preserving payment data.
     - Clears `VNTYDP` (this year’s YTD paid) to 0.

5. **Output to Vendor File (Lines 0040–0049)**:
   - Updates the `APVEND` file for each processed record (indicator `01`):
     - If indicator `50` is on, updates:
       - `VN$YTD` (YTD purchases).
       - `VN$LYR` (last year’s purchases).
       - `VNDYTD` (YTD discounts).
       - `VNTYDP` (this year’s YTD paid).
       - `VNLYDP` (last year’s YTD paid).
     - Updates MTD fields for all records:
       - `VNDMTD` (MTD discounts).
       - `VNPBAL` (previous balance).
       - `VNPURC` (MTD purchases).
       - `VNPAY` (MTD payments).
   - The updates are written to the `APVEND` file, modifying the vendor records.

6. **Program Flow**:
   - The program processes records from `AP300S` (sorted by company and vendor, as prepared by `#GSORT` in `AP300.ocl36.txt`).
   - For each record in `AP300S`, it locates the corresponding record in `APVEND` (via indexing) and applies the MTD and optional YTD updates.
   - The program relies on the `AP300S` file to determine which vendors to update, based on the company selection (`KYALCO`, `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`) from `AP300P.rpg36.txt`.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules for clearing MTD and YTD totals:

1. **MTD Clearing**:
   - Always clears MTD fields for all processed records:
     - `VNDMTD` (MTD discounts) set to 0.
     - `VNPURC` (MTD purchases) set to 0.
     - `VNPAY` (MTD payments) set to 0.
   - Preserves the current balance by moving `VNCBAL` to `VNPBAL` before clearing MTD fields.

2. **YTD Clearing**:
   - Clears YTD fields only if `KYYTDY = 'Y'` (controlled by indicator `50`):
     - Moves `VN$YTD` (YTD purchases) to `VN$LYR` (last year’s purchases).
     - Clears `VN$YTD` and `VNDYTD` (YTD discounts) to 0.
     - Moves `VNTYDP` (this year’s YTD paid) to `VNLYDP` (last year’s YTD paid).
     - Clears `VNTYDP` to 0.
   - Preserves YTD data in last-year fields (`VN$LYR`, `VNLYDP`) for historical reference or auditing.

3. **Record Selection**:
   - Processes only records included in the sorted `AP300S` file, which filters vendors by:
     - Company selection (`ALL` or specific companies `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`) from `AP300P`.
     - Non-deleted status (`NECD ≠ 'D'`) from `AP300.ocl36.txt`.

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensures the current balance (`VNCBAL`) is not modified, maintaining financial accuracy.
   - Preserves YTD data in last-year fields when clearing YTD totals, supporting audit and 1099 requirements.

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Relies on `AP300P.rpg36.txt` to validate user input (`KYYTDY`, company selections).
   - Relies on `AP300.ocl36.txt` to sort `APVEND` into `AP300S` and handle backups for 1099 processing.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program uses the following files:

1. **APVEND**:
   - Type: Disk file (update, `UP`).
   - Purpose: Vendor master file containing financial data (MTD/YTD totals), updated by the program.
   - Record Length: 579 bytes, indexed (`I`).
   - Fields Updated:
     - `VN$YTD`, `VN$LYR`, `VNDMTD`, `VNDYTD`, `VNPBAL`, `VNPURC`, `VNPAY`, `VNTYDP`, `VNLYDP`.
   - Label: `?9?APVEND` (e.g., `PRODAPVEND`).

2. **AP300S**:
   - Type: Disk file (input, `IR`).
   - Purpose: Sorted temporary file containing vendor records to be updated, filtered by company and non-deleted status.
   - Record Length: 30 bytes, indexed with 3-byte keys (likely company and vendor numbers).
   - Label: `?9?AP300S`.

### External Programs Called

The RPG program does not directly call any external programs (e.g., via `CALL` operations). It is executed by the `AP300.ocl36.txt` script and relies on:

1. **#GSORT** (from `AP300.ocl36.txt`):
   - Prepares the `AP300S` file by sorting `APVEND` based on company and vendor fields.
   - Not called directly by `AP300.rpg36.txt` but critical to its input.

2. **AP300P.rpg36.txt** (indirectly):
   - Provides validated parameters (`KYYTDY`, `KYALCO`, `KYCO1`, etc.) via the Local Data Area, set before `AP300` runs.

No other programs are called within the RPG code.

### Summary

**Process Overview**:
- `AP300.rpg36.txt` clears MTD and optionally YTD totals in the `APVEND` vendor master file.
- Processes records from the sorted `AP300S` file, updating:
  - MTD fields (`VNDMTD`, `VNPURC`, `VNPAY`) to 0, with `VNPBAL` set to `VNCBAL`.
  - YTD fields (`VN$YTD`, `VNDYTD`, `VNTYDP`) to 0 if `KYYTDY = 'Y'`, moving current YTD values to last-year fields (`VN$LYR`, `VNLYDP`).
- Updates are written back to `APVEND` for each processed record.

**Business Rules**:
- Always clears MTD fields, preserving the current balance.
- Clears YTD fields only if `KYYTDY = 'Y'`, preserving YTD data in last-year fields.
- Processes only records from `AP300S`, filtered by company and non-deleted status.
- Maintains data integrity for financial accuracy and auditing.

**Tables Used**:
- `APVEND`: Vendor master file (updated).
- `AP300S`: Sorted temporary file (input).

**External Programs**:
- None called directly; relies on `#GSORT` (via `AP300.ocl36.txt`) and `AP300P.rpg36.txt` (for parameters).

This program completes the A/P update process by performing the actual data modifications, integrating with the validation from `AP300P.rpg36.txt` and file management from `AP300.ocl36.txt`.
