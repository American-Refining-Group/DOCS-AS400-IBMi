### List of Use Cases Implemented by the OCL Program (AP795.ocl36.txt)

The OCL program `AP795.ocl36.txt` implements a single primary use case:

1. **Preparation of IRSTAX File for 1099 Reporting**:
   - The program converts 1099 data from the `AP1099` file into the `IRSTAX` file, formatted as required by government regulations, for download to a PC. It supports both production and test environments by handling file names dynamically (using the `?9?` variable) and includes checks to avoid overwriting existing files without user confirmation.

### Function Requirement Document



# Function Requirement Document: IRSTAX File Preparation

## Purpose
To create a function that converts 1099 data from the `AP1099` file into the `IRSTAX` file, formatted for government reporting, suitable for download to a PC. The function operates in both production and test environments, ensuring no data conflicts and adhering to business rules.

## Inputs
- **Source File**: `AP1099` (or `?9?AP1099` in test environment), containing 1099 data.
- **Target Library**: `DATAF1`, where the `IRSTAX` file will be created.
- **Environment Prefix**: `?9?` (string, e.g., `TEST` or empty for production), determines file naming.
- **Record Length**: Fixed at 750 bytes, defining the output file format.
- **Error Handling Flag**: `NE` (No Error), allowing the process to continue despite certain errors.
- **Disposition**: `'D'`, specifying the data copy mode (direct copy).

## Outputs
- **Target File**: `IRSTAX` (or `?9?IRSTAX` in test environment), created in the `DATAF1` library, containing formatted 1099 data ready for government submission.

## Process Steps
1. **Validate Environment**:
   - Determine if the environment is production (`?9?` is empty or `/G`) or test (`?9?` is a prefix like `TEST`).
2. **Check for Existing IRSTAX File**:
   - Verify if `DATAF1-IRSTAX` (or `DATAF1-?9?IRSTAX`) exists.
   - If the file exists, delete it to prevent data conflicts.
3. **Copy Data**:
   - Copy data from `AP1099` (or `?9?AP1099`) to `IRSTAX` (or `?9?IRSTAX`) in the `DATAF1` library.
   - Use a record length of 750 bytes, `NE` error handling, and `'D'` disposition.

## Business Rules
- **File Overwrite Protection**: The function must check for an existing `IRSTAX` file and delete it only if it exists, ensuring no accidental data loss.
- **Environment Flexibility**: Support dynamic file naming based on the `?9?` prefix to accommodate production (`IRSTAX`, `AP1099`) and test (`?9?IRSTAX`, `?9?AP1099`) environments.
- **Data Integrity**: The output `IRSTAX` file must conform to a 750-byte record length to meet government reporting standards.
- **Error Handling**: Use `NE` to allow non-critical errors during the copy process, ensuring the function completes unless a critical failure occurs.
- **Disposition**: Use `'D'` mode to ensure direct data copying without additional transformations unless specified by government requirements.

## Calculations
- No explicit calculations are performed. The function relies on the `COPYDATA` command to handle data transfer, assuming the `AP1099` file is pre-formatted with correct 1099 data (e.g., amounts, payee details) and the 750-byte record length ensures compatibility with government submission formats.

## Assumptions
- The `AP1099` file contains valid 1099 data, pre-validated and formatted for government requirements.
- The `DATAF1` library exists and is accessible for writing the `IRSTAX` file.
- The `?9?` prefix is provided correctly to distinguish between production and test environments.
- The `COPYDATA` command handles any internal data formatting required for the 750-byte record structure.

## Constraints
- The function does not interact with a user interface, relying on input parameters for all decisions.
- No external file I/O beyond the IBM i system (e.g., no direct PC download within the function).
- The function assumes the `COPYDATA` command is available on the IBM i system.
