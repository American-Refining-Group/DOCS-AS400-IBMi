### Explanation of the Process Steps and Business Rules in the RPG Program (AP765N.rpg36.txt)

The RPG III program `AP765N.rpg36.txt` is designed to print vendor 1099-NEC (Non-Employee Compensation) forms on an IBM System/36 or AS/400 system. It is called by the OCL program `AP765N.ocl36.txt` when `?L'110,1'?` is set to `N` in the main OCL (`AP765P.ocl36.txt`), indicating a focus on 1099-NEC forms. This program is similar to `AP765.rpg36.txt` (used for 1099-MISC forms) but has modifications to handle three forms per page instead of two, reflecting differences in form layout or printing requirements for 1099-NEC. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps

1. **Program Setup and File Definitions**:
   - **Header Specification (H)**:
     - Line `0002`: Defines the program name (`AP765N`) and parameter `P016`, likely a control parameter passed from the OCL.
   - **File Specifications (F)**:
     - Line `0008`: `AP766` (Input, Primary, 300 bytes): The preprocessed work file (e.g., `?9?AP766` from the OCL), containing consolidated vendor data from `AP766.rpg36.txt`.
     - Line `0009`: `AP1099` (Output, 80 bytes, Printer): The printer file used to output 1099-NEC forms, configured in the OCL with form type `1099`, 10 CPI, and 6 LPI.
   - **Line Counter Specification (L)**:
     - Line `0011`: Defines line counter settings for `AP1099` with 66 lines per form (`FL 66`) and 66 lines of overflow (`OL 66`), ensuring proper pagination.
   - **Input Specifications (I)**:
     - Lines `0012-0025`: Define fields in the `AP766` file (format `NS 01`):
       - `VNDEL` (1 char, position 1): Delete code.
       - `VN1099` (1 char, position 2): A/P 1099 code (e.g., `N` for Non-Employee Compensation).
       - `VNVEND` (5 chars, positions 3-7): Vendor number.
       - `VNNAME` (30 chars, positions 8-37): Vendor name.
       - `VNADD1-4` (30 chars each, positions 38-157): Address lines 1-4.
       - `L1AMT1` (9,2 numeric, positions 158-166): First box amount.
       - `L1AMT2` (9,2 numeric, positions 167-175): Second box amount.
       - `BOX1` (2 numeric, positions 176-177): First box number.
       - `BOX2` (2 numeric, positions 178-179): Second box number.
       - `VNID#` (11 chars, positions 180-190): 1099 ID number (e.g., Tax ID).
       - `VNPYN1` (40 chars, positions 191-230, added by `JB01`): Payee name 1.
       - `VNPYN2` (40 chars, positions 231-270, added by `JB01`): Payee name 2.
       - `VNNOVF` (1 char, position 271, added by `JB02`): Name overflow indicator.
       - `STATID` (8 chars, positions 272-279): State ID.
       - `STATED` (9,2 numeric, positions 280-288): State amount.
     - Lines `0026-0032`: Define fields in the User Data Structure (`UDS`):
       - `HEAD1` (30 chars, positions 1-30): First heading (e.g., company name).
       - `HEAD2` (30 chars, positions 31-60): Second heading (e.g., address line 1).
       - `HEAD3` (30 chars, positions 61-90): Third heading (e.g., address line 2).
       - `ID#` (10 chars, positions 91-100): Company Tax ID.
       - `ENTAMT` (8,2 numeric, positions 101-108): Threshold amount for printing.
       - `CURLST` (1 char, position 109): Current/Last indicator (`C` or `L`).
       - `CNYEAR` (4 numeric, positions 201-204): Current year.
       - `YEAR` (4 numeric, positions 203-204): Year (overlaps with `CNYEAR`, possibly a typo or legacy field).

2. **Initial Vendor Processing**:
   - **Indicator Reset**:
     - Line `C*`: Set indicator `33` off (disabling 1099-MISC logic, as this program is for 1099-NEC).
   - **1099 Type Check**:
     - Lines `C*`: If `VN1099` is `N`, set indicator `34` on (for 1099-NEC).
     - The commented-out logic for `VN1099 = 'M'` (1099-MISC) indicates this program is exclusively for 1099-NEC.
   - **Vendor Number Check**:
     - Lines `C*`: If `VNVEND` equals `32800`, set `YES` to `'YES'` (3 chars). This likely flags a specific vendor for special handling, though its purpose is unclear (different from `9384` in `AP765`).

3. **Amount Validation**:
   - Line `0034`: Add `L1AMT1` and `L1AMT2` to compute `TOTAMT` (9,2 numeric), the total vendor payment.
   - Line `0035`: Compare `TOTAMT` with `ENTAMT` (threshold amount from `UDS`). Set indicator `30` if `TOTAMT` is greater than or equal to `ENTAMT`.
   - Line `0036`: If indicator `30` is off (`N30`), skip to the `END` tag, bypassing the vendor (i.e., only vendors meeting the threshold are printed).

4. **Form Counter Logic**:
   - Lines `C*`: Manage the `COUNTP` (2 numeric) field to track whether the first (`31`), second (`32`), or third (`40`) form on the page is being processed:
     - If `COUNTP` is `2`, increment to `3`, set indicator `40` on (third form), set `32` off, and jump to `SKIP`.
     - If `COUNTP` is zero, set it to `1`, set `31` on (first form), set `32` and `40` off.
     - Otherwise, increment `COUNTP`, set `31` and `40` off, set `32` on (second form).
     - This supports printing **three forms per page**, a key difference from `AP765` (which prints two forms per page, revision `MG03`).

5. **Clear Work Fields**:
   - Lines `JB01`: For each form (indicators `31`, `32`, `40`):
     - Clear fields for payee names (`PYN11`, `PYN12`, `PYN13`, `PYN21`, `PYN22`, `PYN23`), tax IDs (`VNID#1`, `VNID#2`, `VNID#3`), state amounts (`STATE1`, `STATE2`, `STATE3`), state IDs (`STATI1`, `STATI2`, `STATI3`), vendor numbers (`VNVEN1`, `VNVEN2`, `VNVEN3`), addresses (`ADDR11`, `ADDR12`, `ADDR13`, `ADDR21`, `ADDR22`, `ADDR23`, `CTSTZ1`, `CTSTZ2`, `CTSTZ3`), and amounts (`AMT11`, `AMT12`, `AMT13`, `AMT31`, `AMT32`, `AMT33`, `AMT61`, `AMT62`, `AMT63`, `AMT71`, `AMT72`, `AMT73`).
     - Reset indicators `71`, `72`, `73`, `35`, `36`, `37` to control name and address printing.

6. **Payee and Address Processing (First Form, Indicator `31`)**:
   - Lines `JB01`: Determine whether to use vendor name or payee names:
     - If `VNPYN1` is blank, use `VNNAME` for `PYN11` (vendor name).
     - If `VNNOVF` is `Y` (name overflow, revision `JB02`), set indicators `35` and `71` on.
     - If `VNPYN1` is not blank, use `VNPYN1` for `PYN11` and set `71` on. If `VNPYN2` is not blank, use `VNPYN2` for `PYN21` and set `71` on.
   - Lines `0045-0069`: Assign address fields based on non-blank values:
     - If `VNADD4` is not blank, set `CTSTZ1` (city/state/ZIP) to `VNADD4`, `VNAD21` to `VNADD3`, `VNAD11` to `VNADD2`, and `PYN21` to `VNADD1`.
     - Else if `VNADD3` is not blank, set `CTSTZ1` to `VNADD3`, `VNAD21` to `VNADD2`, `PYN21` to `VNADD1`.
     - Else if `VNADD2` is not blank, set `CTSTZ1` to `VNADD2`, `PYN21` to `VNADD1`.
     - Else if `VNADD1` is not blank, set `CTSTZ1` to `VNADD1`.
     - If none are non-blank, set indicator `73` on (likely to skip address printing).
     - Jump to `CONT1` tag after address assignment.
   - Lines `0045-0069` (non-overflow case, `N35`): Similar address assignment without overflow logic.

7. **Payee and Address Processing (Second Form, Indicator `32`)**:
   - Identical logic to the first form, but for fields `PYN12`, `PYN22`, `VNAD12`, `CTSTZ2`, with indicators `36` and `72`, jumping to `CONT2` tag.

8. **Payee and Address Processing (Third Form, Indicator `40`)**:
   - Identical logic to the first form, but for fields `PYN13`, `PYN23`, `VNAD13`, `CTSTZ3`, with indicators `37` and `73`, jumping to `CONT3` tag.

9. **Address Processing (Non-Overflow, `CONT3`, `CONT4`, `CONT5`)**:
   - Lines `0045-0069`: For each form (`31N35`, `32N36`, `40N37`), assign address fields similarly to ensure proper formatting when no name overflow occurs, jumping to `CONT3`, `CONT4`, or `CONT5` tags.

10. **Amount Assignment for Printing**:
    - Lines `0071-0094`: Assign amounts to specific 1099 box fields based on `BOX1` and `BOX2` for each form (`31`, `32`, `40`):
      - For `BOX1`:
        - If `1`, set `AMT11`/`AMT12`/`AMT13` to `L1AMT1` (box 1 for 1099-NEC).
        - If `3`, set `AMT31`/`AMT32`/`AMT33` to `L1AMT1` (box 3, possibly for other forms).
        - If `6`, set `AMT61`/`AMT62`/`AMT63` to `L1AMT1` (box 6, possibly for other forms).
        - If `7`, set `AMT71`/`AMT72`/`AMT73` to `L1AMT1` (box 7, standard for 1099-NEC Non-Employee Compensation).
      - For `BOX2`:
        - If `1`, set `AMT11`/`AMT12`/`AMT13` to `L1AMT2`.
        - If `3`, set `AMT31`/`AMT32`/`AMT33` to `L1AMT2`.
        - If `6`, set `AMT61`/`AMT62`/`AMT63` to `L1AMT2`.
        - If `7`, set `AMT71`/`AMT72`/`AMT73` to `L1AMT2`.

11. **Accumulate Totals**:
    - Lines `0095-0098`: For each form (`31`, `32`, `40`):
      - Increment `COUNT` (6 numeric, total vendors printed).
      - Add `AMT11`/`AMT12`/`AMT13` to `LRAMT1` (10,2 numeric, total for box 1).
      - Add `AMT31`/`AMT32`/`AMT33` to `LRAMT3` (total for box 3).
      - Add `AMT61`/`AMT62`/`AMT63` to `LRAMT6` (total for box 6).
      - Add `AMT71`/`AMT72`/`AMT73` to `LRAMT7` (total for box 7).

12. **Page Break Logic**:
    - Lines `C*`: If `COUNTP` equals `3` (all three forms on the page filled):
      - Reset `COUNTP` to zero, set indicators `31`, `32`, `40` on, and execute an `EXCPT` to print the page.
    - At end of file (`LR` on):
      - If data remains for the first form (`31` on), set indicator `30` on, clear `TEST` (11 chars), and execute `EXCPT` to print a final page with one vendor.
      - Unlike `AP765`, this program does not compute a grand total (`LRAMT`) across all boxes, focusing only on individual box totals.

13. **Output to Printer**:
    - Lines `0107-0140`: Define the output format for `AP1099`:
      - **First Form (Indicator `31`)**:
        - Lines 5-23: Print company headers (`HEAD1-3`), year (`CNYEAR`), tax IDs (`ID#`, `VNID#1`), payee names (`PYN11`, `PYN21`), addresses (`VNAD11`, `VNAD21`, `CTSTZ1`), amounts (`AMT11`, `AMT31`, `AMT61`, `AMT71`), and vendor number (`VNVEN1`, revision `JB02`).
        - Conditional on `34` (1099-NEC) for primary amount (`AMT11`) and `N34` for other boxes (`AMT31`).
      - **Second Form (Indicator `32`)**:
        - Similar fields for the second form, using `PYN12`, `PYN22`, `VNAD12`, `CTSTZ2`, `AMT12`, `AMT32`, `AMT62`, `AMT72`, `VNID#2`, `VNVEN2`.
      - **Third Form (Indicator `40`)**:
        - Similar fields for the third form, using `PYN13`, `PYN23`, `VNAD13`, `CTSTZ3`, `AMT13`, `AMT33`, `AMT63`, `AMT73`, `VNID#3`, `VNVEN3`.
      - **Totals (LR)**:
        - Print `HEAD1-3`, `ID#`, totals (`LRAMT1`, `LRAMT6`, `LRAMT7`), and vendor count (`COUNT`). Notably, `LRAMT3` is printed but not accumulated for `40`, indicating a possible oversight or specific requirement.

---

### Business Rules

1. **Threshold Check**:
   - Only vendors with a total amount (`TOTAMT` = `L1AMT1` + `L1AMT2`) greater than or equal to `ENTAMT` are printed.

2. **Three Forms per Page**:
   - The program prints three 1099-NEC forms per page on laser paper (revision `MG03`, modified for three forms), managed by `COUNTP` and indicators `31`, `32`, `40`.
   - If fewer than three vendors remain at the end, a final page with one or two vendors is printed.

3. **Payee Name Handling**:
   - If `VNPYN1` is blank, use `VNNAME` (vendor name). Otherwise, use `VNPYN1` and `VNPYN2` (payee names, revision `JB01`).
   - If `VNNOVF` is `Y`, use address fields to continue the name on the second line (revision `JB02`).

4. **Address Formatting**:
   - Use the highest non-blank address field (`VNADD4` to `VNADD1`) for city/state/ZIP (`CTSTZ1`/`CTSTZ2`/`CTSTZ3`) and shift other fields accordingly to ensure proper formatting.

5. **Box Amount Assignment**:
   - Amounts are assigned to boxes 1, 3, 6, or 7 based on `BOX1` and `BOX2`, with a focus on box 7 for 1099-NEC Non-Employee Compensation (revision `MG04` supports multiple form types).

6. **1099 Type**:
   - Indicator `34` is set for `VN1099 = 'N'` (1099-NEC). The commented-out logic for `M` (1099-MISC) ensures this program is dedicated to 1099-NEC.

7. **Totals**:
   - Accumulate totals for boxes 1, 3, 6, and 7 (`LRAMT1`, `LRAMT3`, `LRAMT6`, `LRAMT7`) and vendor count (`COUNT`). Unlike `AP765`, no grand total (`LRAMT`) is computed.

8. **Vendor Number as Account Number**:
   - Print `VNVEND` as the account number (`VNVEN1`/`VNVEN2`/`VNVEN3`, revision `JB02`).

---

### Comparison with AP765.rpg36.txt

- **Similarity**:
  - Both programs read `AP766`, validate amounts against `ENTAMT`, handle payee names and addresses, assign amounts to boxes 1, 3, 6, or 7, and print to `AP1099`.
  - Both support revisions `JB01` (payee names), `JB02` (name overflow, vendor number as account), `MG03` (laser paper), and `MG04` (multiple form types).
- **Differences**:
  - **Forms per Page**: `AP765` prints two forms per page (`COUNTP` up to 2, indicators `31`/`32`), while `AP765N` prints three forms per page (`COUNTP` up to 3, indicators `31`/`32`/`40`).
  - **1099 Type**: `AP765` handles both 1099-MISC (`VN1099 = 'M'`, indicator `33`) and 1099-NEC (`VN1099 = 'N'`, indicator `34`), while `AP765N` is dedicated to 1099-NEC (`VN1099 = 'N'`, indicator `34` only).
  - **Vendor Number Check**: `AP765` checks for `VNVEND = 9384`, while `AP765N` checks for `VNVEND = 32800`.
  - **Totals**: `AP765` computes a grand total (`LRAMT`), while `AP765N` does not, though it prints `LRAMT3` in the totals section without accumulating it for `40`.
  - **Output Lines**: `AP765N` has fewer active output lines for amounts (e.g., `AMT61`, `AMT71` are commented out), focusing on 1099-NEC fields.

---

### Tables/Files Used

1. **AP766**:
   - Input file (300 bytes, labeled `?9?AP766` in the OCL, e.g., `XXAP766`).
   - Contains preprocessed vendor data from `AP766.rpg36.txt`, including vendor details, amounts, box numbers, and payee names.

2. **AP1099**:
   - Output printer file (80 bytes, labeled `AP1099` in the OCL).
   - Configured to print 1099-NEC forms with form type `1099`, 10 CPI, 6 LPI, three forms per page.

3. **PA1099X** (Implied):
   - Referenced in the OCL (`?9?PA1099X`), likely a cross-reference file, but not used directly in this program.

---

### External Programs Called

- None are explicitly called within `AP765N`. It is invoked by `AP765N.ocl36.txt` and processes data from `AP766.rpg36.txt`, with input prepared by `#GSORT` and `AP766`.

---

### Outputs

1. **AP1099 Printer File**:
   - Prints 1099-NEC forms (three per page) with:
     - Company headers (`HEAD1`, `HEAD2`, `HEAD3`).
     - Year (`CNYEAR`).
     - Company Tax ID (`ID#`) and vendor Tax ID (`VNID#1`/`VNID#2`/`VNID#3`).
     - Payee names (`PYN11`/`PYN12`/`PYN13`, `PYN21`/`PYN22`/`PYN23`) or vendor name (`VNNAME`).
     - Addresses (`VNAD11`/`VNAD12`/`VNAD13`, `VNAD21`/`VNAD22`/`VNAD23`, `CTSTZ1`/`CTSTZ2`/`CTSTZ3`).
     - Amounts for boxes 1, 3, 6, or 7 (`AMT11`/`AMT12`/`AMT13`, `AMT31`/`AMT32`/`AMT33`, `AMT61`/`AMT62`/`AMT63`, `AMT71`/`AMT72`/`AMT73`), primarily box 7 for 1099-NEC.
     - Vendor number as account number (`VNVEN1`/`VNVEN2`/`VNVEN3`, revision `JB02`).
   - Final page includes totals (`LRAMT1`, `LRAMT6`, `LRAMT7`, `LRAMT3` for `31`/`32` only) and vendor count (`COUNT`).

---

### Summary

- **Purpose**: The RPG program `AP765N` prints 1099-NEC forms, formatting three forms per page on laser paper, using preprocessed vendor data from `AP766`.
- **Process**:
  - Reads `AP766` and validates vendor amounts against `ENTAMT`.
  - Manages three forms per page with `COUNTP` and indicators `31`/`32`/`40`.
  - Assigns payee names, addresses, and amounts to appropriate fields, focusing on 1099-NEC.
  - Prints forms with company and vendor details, amounts, and totals.
- **Business Rules**:
  - Prints only vendors meeting the amount threshold.
  - Supports three forms per page and 1099-NEC exclusively.
  - Handles payee names, name overflow, and vendor number as account number.
  - Accumulates totals for boxes 1, 3, 6, and 7, but not a grand total.
- **Files Used**:
  - Input: `AP766` (preprocessed vendor data).
  - Output: `AP1099` (printer file for 1099-NEC forms).
- **External Programs**: None called directly; part of a workflow with `#GSORT`, `AP766`, and `AP765N.ocl36.txt`.

This program is tailored for 1099-NEC forms, differing from `AP765` by supporting three forms per page and focusing exclusively on Non-Employee Compensation, ensuring IRS-compliant output for vendors.
