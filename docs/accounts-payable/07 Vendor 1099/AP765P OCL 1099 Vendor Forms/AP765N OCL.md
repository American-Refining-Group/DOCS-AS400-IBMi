### Explanation of the Process Steps and Business Rules in the OCL Program (AP765N.ocl36.txt)

The OCL (Operation Control Language) program `AP765N.ocl36.txt` is an alternative path for processing vendor 1099 forms on an IBM System/36 or AS/400 system, called conditionally from `AP765P.ocl36.txt` when `?L'110,1'?` is `N` instead of `M`. It is nearly identical to `AP765.ocl36.txt` but invokes `AP765N` instead of `AP765` for printing the 1099 forms, suggesting a variation in the printing process (likely for 1099-NEC forms instead of 1099-MISC). Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **GSY2K**: Invokes a system routine to ensure Year 2000 compliance for date handling.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `?10?`: Specifies the four-digit year for the 1099 file (e.g., 2012).
     - `?13?`: Specifies the 1099 file name (e.g., `APVN2012`), containing vendor data.
   - **Programmer Note**: The file `APVNYYYY` (e.g., `APVN2012`) is created during the period-end process (`AP300`) and is a snapshot of the `GAPVEND` file before monthly and yearly totals are cleared.

2. **Delete Temporary File (if exists)**:
   - `IF DATAF1-?9?AP766 DELETE ?9?AP766,F1`: Checks if the temporary file `?9?AP766` (e.g., `XXAP766`, where `?9?` is a prefix) exists. If it does, the file is deleted to ensure a clean start for processing.

3. **Sort Input File**:
   - `LOAD #GSORT`: Loads the system sort utility (`#GSORT`).
   - **Input File**:
     - `FILE NAME-INPUT,LABEL-?13?,DISP-SHR`: Specifies the input file as `?13?` (e.g., `APVN2012`), opened in shared mode (`DISP-SHR`).
   - **Output File**:
     - `FILE NAME-OUTPUT,LABEL-?9?AP765S,RECORDS-999000,EXTEND-999000,RETAIN-J`: Creates a sorted output file named `?9?AP765S` (e.g., `XXAP765S`), with a capacity of 999,000 records, extendable by another 999,000, and retained as a job file (`RETAIN-J`).
   - **Sort Specifications**:
     - `HSORTA 22A 3X N`: Defines an ascending sort (`A`) on a 22-character field starting at position 3, with no sequence checking (`N`).
     - `O C 264EQC`: Includes records where the field at position 264 equals a constant value (likely a flag or type indicator).
     - `I*`: Includes all records.
     - `I C 1NECD`: Includes records where position 1 equals `N`, `E`, `C`, or `D` (likely 1099 types: Non-Employee Compensation, etc.).
     - `IAC 264 264EQC?L'110,1'?`: Conditionally includes records based on the value of `?L'110,1'?` (in this case, `N` for 1099-NEC).
     - **Sort Fields**:
       - `FNC 264 264`: Sorts on the 1099 type field (position 264, 1 character).
       - `FNC 4 8`: Sorts on the vendor field (positions 4-8, 5 characters).
       - `FNC 2 3`: Sorts on the company field (positions 2-3, 2 characters).
   - `RUN`: Executes the sort, producing the sorted file `?9?AP765S`.
   - **Purpose**: Sorts vendor data by 1099 type (likely filtered for `N`), vendor, and company to organize records for processing.

4. **Process Sorted Data**:
   - `LOAD AP766`: Loads the program `AP766` (an RPG program for data processing, as described in `AP766.rpg36.txt`).
   - **Files Used**:
     - `FILE NAME-APVEND,LABEL-?13?,DISP-SHR`: Input file `?13?` (e.g., `APVN2012`), shared mode.
     - `FILE NAME-AP765S,LABEL-?9?AP765S`: Sorted input file `?9?AP765S` from the sort step.
     - `FILE NAME-AP766,LABEL-?9?AP766,RECORDS-1000,EXTEND-500`: Output file `?9?AP766`, with an initial capacity of 1,000 records, extendable by 500.
     - `FILE NAME-PA1099X,LABEL-?9?PA1099X,DISP-SHR`: Cross-reference or configuration file `?9?PA1099X`, opened in shared mode.
   - `RUN`: Executes `AP766`, which processes the sorted vendor data and produces the output file `?9?AP766`.
   - **Purpose**: Consolidates vendor records (one per vendor) and prepares data for printing, likely focusing on 1099-NEC forms due to `?L'110,1'?` being `N`.

5. **Print 1099 Forms**:
   - `LOAD AP765N`: Loads the program `AP765N` (an RPG program for printing, distinct from `AP765`).
   - **File Used**:
     - `FILE NAME-AP766,LABEL-?9?AP766,DISP-SHR`: Input file `?9?AP766`, the processed data from `AP766`, shared mode.
   - **Printer Configuration**:
     - `OVRPRTF FILE(AP1099) FORMTYPE(1099) CPI(10) LPI(6)`: Overrides printer file `AP1099` to use form type `1099`, with 10 characters per inch (`CPI`) and 6 lines per inch (`LPI`).
     - The commented line `PRINTER NAME-AP1099,FORMSNO-1099,ALIGN-YES,LPI-6,CPI-10` suggests similar settings for older syntax compatibility.
   - `RUN`: Executes `AP765N`, which prints the 1099 forms (likely 1099-NEC) using the data in `?9?AP766`.
   - **Purpose**: Generates the final 1099 forms, tailored for the `N` type (Non-Employee Compensation).

6. **Cleanup Temporary File**:
   - `IF DATAF1-?9?AP766 DELETE ?9?AP766,F1`: After processing, checks if the temporary file `?9?AP766` exists and deletes it to clean up.

---

### Business Rules

1. **Input File Validation**:
   - The input file `?13?` (e.g., `APVN2012`) must exist and contain vendor data from the period-end process (`AP300`).
   - It is a snapshot of `GAPVEND` before monthly and yearly totals are cleared.

2. **Data Sorting**:
   - Vendor records are sorted by:
     - 1099 type (position 264, likely `N` for Non-Employee Compensation due to `?L'110,1'?`).
     - Vendor code (positions 4-8).
     - Company code (positions 2-3).
   - Only records matching specific 1099 types (`N`, `E`, `C`, `D`) or the value in `?L'110,1'?` (`N`) are included.

3. **Temporary Files**:
   - Temporary files `?9?AP765S` and `?9?AP766` are created during processing and deleted afterward to avoid conflicts in subsequent runs.
   - `?9?AP765S` is a sorted version of the input file.
   - `?9?AP766` contains processed data ready for printing.

4. **File Retention**:
   - The sorted file `?9?AP765S` is retained as a job file (`RETAIN-J`), ensuring it persists for the duration of the job.

5. **Printer Configuration**:
   - The 1099 forms are printed with specific formatting (10 CPI, 6 LPI) on form type `1099`, ensuring IRS compliance, likely for 1099-NEC forms.

6. **Year 2000 Compliance**:
   - The `GSY2K` routine ensures proper date handling for the year specified in `?10?`.

7. **Conditional Path**:
   - This program is called when `?L'110,1'?` is `N` in `AP765P.ocl36.txt`, indicating a focus on 1099-NEC forms rather than 1099-MISC (handled by `AP765.ocl36.txt`).

---

### Tables/Files Used

1. **Input File**:
   - `?13?` (e.g., `APVN2012`): The vendor file created by `AP300`, a snapshot of `GAPVEND` containing vendor data. Used in the sort and processing steps.

2. **Temporary Files**:
   - `?9?AP765S` (e.g., `XXAP765S`): Sorted output file created by `#GSORT`, used as input for `AP766`.
   - `?9?AP766` (e.g., `XXAP766`): Processed output file created by `AP766`, used as input for `AP765N` to print 1099 forms.

3. **Cross-Reference File**:
   - `?9?PA1099X` (e.g., `XXPA1099X`): A configuration or cross-reference file used by `AP766`, opened in shared mode.

4. **Printer File**:
   - `AP1099`: The printer file used by `AP765N` to output 1099 forms, configured with form type `1099`, 10 CPI, and 6 LPI.

---

### External Programs Called

1. **#GSORT**:
   - The system sort utility, used to sort the input file `?13?` into `?9?AP765S` based on 1099 type, vendor, and company.

2. **AP766**:
   - An RPG program (`AP766.rpg36.txt`) that processes the sorted file `?9?AP765S` and the vendor file `?13?`, producing the processed file `?9?AP766`. It uses the cross-reference file `?9?PA1099X`.

3. **AP765N**:
   - An RPG program (not provided, but referenced in the OCL) that reads the processed file `?9?AP766` and prints 1099 forms (likely 1099-NEC) to the printer file `AP1099`.

4. **AP300** (Referenced):
   - Mentioned in the programmer note as the period-end process that creates the `APVNYYYY` file (`?13?`). Not called directly in this program.

---

### Outputs

1. **Sorted File**:
   - `?9?AP765S`: A temporary file containing sorted vendor data, created by `#GSORT`.

2. **Processed File**:
   - `?9?AP766`: A temporary file containing processed data ready for printing, created by `AP766`.

3. **Printed 1099 Forms**:
   - Output to the printer file `AP1099`, formatted as 1099 forms (likely 1099-NEC due to `?L'110,1'?` being `N`), with 10 CPI, 6 LPI.

---

### Comparison with AP765.ocl36.txt

- **Similarity**: `AP765N.ocl36.txt` is nearly identical to `AP765.ocl36.txt`, with the same file handling, sorting logic, and cleanup steps. Both use `#GSORT` and `AP766` for preprocessing and produce output via `AP1099`.
- **Difference**: The key difference is the printing program:
  - `AP765.ocl36.txt` calls `AP765` (likely for 1099-MISC forms, as `?L'110,1'?` is `M`).
  - `AP765N.ocl36.txt` calls `AP765N` (likely for 1099-NEC forms, as `?L'110,1'?` is `N`).
  - This suggests `AP765N` may have specific formatting or logic tailored for 1099-NEC, such as different box assignments or layout.
