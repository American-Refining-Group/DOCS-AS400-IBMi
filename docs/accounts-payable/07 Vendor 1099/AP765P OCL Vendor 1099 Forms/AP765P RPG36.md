The RPG36 program `AP765P` is designed to handle prompts for a Vendor 1099 form, likely used for tax reporting purposes. It defines a screen interface to collect and validate input data related to vendor information. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps

1. **File and Data Structure Definitions**:
   - **File Definition (F-Spec)**:
     - `SCREEN` is defined as a workstation file (`WORKSTN`) with a record length of 512 bytes, used for interactive screen input/output.
   - **Array Definition (E-Spec)**:
     - `MSG` is an array to store five error messages, each 35 characters long, used for displaying validation errors.
   - **Input Specifications (I-Spec)**:
     - Two formats are defined for the `SCREEN` file:
       - **Format 01**: Input fields include `HEAD1` (30 chars), `HEAD2` (30 chars), `HEAD3` (30 chars), `ID#` (10 chars), `ENTAMT` (8 chars, 2 decimal places), `TYPE` (1 char), and `CURLST` (1 char).
       - **Format 09**: Similar fields but mapped via a data structure (`UDS`) with slightly different positions.
   - **Output Specifications (O-Spec)**:
     - Defines the output format `AP765PS1` for the screen, writing fields like `HEAD1`, `HEAD2`, `HEAD3`, `ID#`, `ENTAMT`, `TYPE`, `CURLST`, and `MSGE` (error message).

2. **Calculation Specifications (C-Spec)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Lines 0029–0031: Reset indicators 81, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, and 96 to off.
     - Line 0032: Clear the `MSGE` field to blanks.
   - **Key Processing (KG)**:
     - If the `KG` (likely a function key like F3 or Cancel) is pressed:
       - Line 0034: Turn off indicator 81.
       - Line 0035: Turn on indicators U1 and LR (Last Record, typically to exit).
       - Line 0036: Branch to the `END` tag to terminate the program.
   - **Screen Format 09 Handling**:
     - Line 0040: If format 09 is active (likely a specific screen state or input), set indicators 81 and 94, then branch to `END`.
   - **Screen Format 01 Handling**:
     - Line 0043: If format 01 is active, execute the subroutine `SUBSC1` for input validation.
   - **Subroutine SUBSC1 (Lines 0047–0077)**:
     - Validates input fields in the following order, setting error indicators and messages if validation fails:
       1. **HEAD1** (Line 0049–0052): Check if blank. If blank, set indicators 81 and 91, move message 1 ("FIRST HEADING CANNOT BE BLANK") to `MSGE`, and branch to `ENDSC1`.
       2. **HEAD2** (Line 0054–0057): Check if blank. If blank, set indicators 81 and 92, move message 2 ("SECOND HEADING CANNOT BE BLANK") to `MSGE`, and branch to `ENDSC1`.
       3. **ID#** (Line 0059–0062): Check if blank. If blank, set indicators 81 and 93, move message 3 ("ID# CANNOT BE BLANK - TRY AGAIN!") to `MSGE`, and branch to `ENDSC1`.
       4. **TYPE** (Line 0064–0069): Check if value is one of 'D' (Dividend), 'I' (Interest), 'M' (Miscellaneous), or 'N' (Nonemployee Compensation). If not, set indicators 81 and 95, move message 4 ("ENTER I-INT, D-DIV, M-MISC, N-NEC") to `MSGE`, and branch to `ENDSC1`.
       5. **CURLST** (Line 0071–0075): Check if value is 'C' (Current) or 'L' (Last). If not, set indicators 81 and 96, move message 5 ("ENTER 'C'-CURR OR 'L'-LAST") to `MSGE`, and branch to `ENDSC1`.
     - If any validation fails, the program branches to `ENDSC1`, which ends the subroutine and returns control to the main logic, typically redisplaying the screen with the error message.
   - **Program Termination**:
     - Line 0045: The `END` tag marks the point where the program terminates after processing or if a function key or validation triggers an exit.

3. **Output Processing**:
   - Lines 0079–0088: Write the `AP765PS1` format to the screen, including all input fields and the error message (`MSGE`) if applicable. The `81` indicator controls whether this is the first time the screen is displayed.

### Business Rules

1. **Mandatory Fields**:
   - `HEAD1`, `HEAD2`, and `ID#` cannot be blank. If any are blank, an error message is displayed, and the screen is redisplayed.
2. **Valid Values for TYPE**:
   - Must be one of 'D' (Dividend), 'I' (Interest), 'M' (Miscellaneous), or 'N' (Nonemployee Compensation). Invalid values trigger an error.
3. **Valid Values for CURLST**:
   - Must be 'C' (Current) or 'L' (Last). Invalid values trigger an error.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Validation errors set specific indicators (91–96) to highlight the erroneous field and display a corresponding message from the `MSG` array.
   - Indicator 81 controls screen redisplay when validation fails.
5. **Program Exit**:
   - Pressing a function key (`KG`) sets the `LR` indicator and exits the program.
   - Format 09 processing also leads to an immediate exit with indicators 81 and 94 set.

### Tables Used

- **MSG Array**:
  - An array defined in the E-Spec (line 0009) to store five error messages, each 35 characters long, used for validation feedback:
    1. "FIRST HEADING CANNOT BE BLANK"
    2. "SECOND HEADING CANNOT BE BLANK"
    3. "ID# CANNOT BE BLANK - TRY AGAIN!"
    4. "ENTER I-INT, D-DIV, M-MISC, N-NEC"
    5. "ENTER 'C'-CURR OR 'L'-LAST"
- **No database files** are explicitly defined in the program, indicating that this program focuses on screen input validation rather than database interaction.

### External Programs Called

- **None**:
  - The program does not explicitly call any external programs (no `CALL` statements or references to other programs).
  - It is invoked from a main OCL (Operation Control Language) script, as mentioned, but no details about the OCL or other programs are provided in the code.

### Summary

The `AP765P` program is a screen-based input validation program for a Vendor 1099 form. It:
- Collects input for fields like headings (`HEAD1`, `HEAD2`, `HEAD3`), vendor ID (`ID#`), amount (`ENTAMT`), type (`TYPE`), and current/last indicator (`CURLST`).
- Validates these fields to ensure they are not blank (for headings and ID#) and contain valid values (for `TYPE` and `CURLST`).
- Displays error messages from the `MSG` array if validation fails.
- Uses a workstation file (`SCREEN`) for interactive input/output.
- Exits on function key press or specific screen format (09) processing.
- Does not interact with database files or call external programs.

This program is likely part of a larger system where the validated data is passed back to the calling OCL for further processing, such as generating 1099 forms for tax reporting.
