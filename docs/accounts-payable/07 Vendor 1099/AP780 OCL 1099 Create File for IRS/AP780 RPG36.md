The `AP780.rpg36.txt` is an RPG/36 program called by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) to create the final IRS 1099 file (`AP1099`) for Accounts Payable (A/P) processing. It processes vendor data from the `AP781` file, generates structured IRS records (Transmitter "T", Payer "A", Payee "B", End of Payer "C", and End of Transmission "F"), and applies specific business rules for 1099-DIV, 1099-INT, 1099-MISC, and 1099-NEC forms. Below, I’ll detail the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AP780 RPG/36 Program

The program processes the input file `AP781`, generates the output file `AP1099`, and creates a structured 1099 file with records formatted according to IRS specifications. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **File and Data Structure Definitions**:
   - **Files**:
     - `AP781`: Input file (320 bytes), containing vendor data.
     - `AP1099`: Output file (750 bytes), the final 1099 file for IRS submission.
   - **Input Record (AP781)**:
     - `VNDEL` (1): Delete code.
     - `VN1099L1` (2): 1099 code (`D` for DIV, `I` for INT, `M` for MISC, `N` for NEC).
     - `VNVEND` (3–7): Vendor number.
     - `VNNAME` (8–37): Vendor name.
     - `VNADD1` (38–67): Address line 1.

     - `VNNAM4` (128–131): Name control (4 characters).
     - `VNPYN1` (132–171): Payee name 1.
     - `VNPYN2` (172–211): Payee name 2.
     - `VNADD2` (212–241): Address line 2.
     - `VNNOVF` (242): Name overflow indicator (`Y` if address line 1 continues as name part 2).
     - `VNNMCT` (243–246): IRS name control (added in revision JK01).
     - `VNFNAM`, `VNMNAM`, `VNLNAM`, `VNSUFF` (247–320): First, middle, last names, and suffix.
   - **User Data Structure (UDS)**:

     - `HDZIP` (92–100): Transmitter ZIP.
     - `ID#` (101–110): Transmitter tax ID (split into `ID1`, `ID2`).
     - `ENTAMT` (111–118, zoned): Entered amount.
     - `YEAR` (119–122, zoned): 1099 year.
     - `CNTACT` (124–143): Contact name.
     - `CNTPH#` (144–153): Contact phone number.
     - `FORM` (160): Form type.
     - `TOTB` (201–208, zoned): Total amount for transmitter record.
   - **Other Fields**:
     - Various zero-filled (`ZEROxx`) and blank-filled (`BLNKxx`) fields for IRS record padding.
     - `RECSEQ` (8, zoned): Record sequence number.
     - `TOTGR1` to `TOTGR7` (15, zoned): Control totals for payment amounts.
     - `COUNT` (8, zoned): Payee count.
     - `TOTA` (8, zoned): Payer record count.
     - `TYPE` (2): 1099 form type (`1` for DIV, `6` for INT, `A` for MISC, `NE` for NEC).

2. **Initialization (ONCE)**:
   - If `ONCE` is zero (first iteration):
     - Initializes `RECSEQ`, `ZERO03`, `Z1`, `ZERO04`, `ZERO06`, `ZERO12`, `ZERO15` to zeros.
     - Initializes `BLNKxx` fields to blanks.
     - Increments `RECSEQ` and writes the Transmitter "T" record (`EXCPT ADDT`).
     - Sets `ONCE` to 1 to prevent re-execution.

3. **Main Processing Loop (Level 1, L1)**:
   - For each `AP781` record:
     - Increments `TOTA` (count of Payer "A" records).
     - Resets `COUNT`, `TOTGR1`, `TOTGR2`, `TOTGR3`, `TOTGR6`, `TOTGR7` to zeros.
     - Sets `TYPE` based on `VN1099`:
       - `D` (Dividend) → `TYPE = '1 '`, indicator 31.
       - `I` (Interest) → `TYPE = '6 '`, indicator 32.
       - `M` (Miscellaneous) → `TYPE = 'A '`, indicator 33.
       - `N` (Non-employee Compensation) → `TYPE = 'NE'`, indicator 34.
     - Increments `RECSEQ` and writes a Payer "A" record (`EXCPT ADDA`).

4. **Payee Name and Address Handling**:
   - Initializes `NAM4` (name control) to blanks, then sets to `VNNMCT` (IRS name control).
   - Clears `PYN1` and `PYN2` to blanks, resets indicators 71 and 72.
   - If `VNPYN1` is blank:
     - If `NAM4` is blank, sets `NAM4` to `VNNAM4`.
     - Sets `PYN1` to `VNNAME`.
     - If `VNNOVF = 'Y'`, sets `PYN2` to `VNADD1`, moves `VNADD2` to `VNADD1`, clears `VNADD2`, sets indicator 72.
   - If `VNPYN1` is not blank:
     - If `NAM4` is blank, sets `NAM4` to `VNNAM4`.
     - Sets `PYN1` to `VNPYN1`, sets indicator 71.
     - If `VNPYN2` is not blank, sets `PYN2` to `VNPYN2`, sets indicator 72.
   - This ensures payee names (`VNPYN1`, `VNPYN2`) are used if provided; otherwise, vendor name (`VNNAME`) is used, with address overflow handling.

5. **Payment Amount Processing**:
   - Resets indicators 41, 46, 47, 51, 56, 57.
   - Increments `COUNT` (payee count).
   - Checks if `VNDASH = '-'` to determine EIN (`20`) or SSN (`N20`) for tax ID.
   - Accumulates totals based on form type:
     - For 1099-DIV (indicator 31): Adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR1` and `TOTGR2`.
     - For 1099-INT (indicator 32): Adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR1`.
     - For 1099-MISC (indicator 33):
       - If `BOX1 = 1` (Rents), sets indicator 41, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR1`.
       - If `BOX1 = 3` (Other Income), sets indicator 43, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR3`.
       - If `BOX1 = 6` (Medical), sets indicator 46, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR6`.
       - If `BOX2 = 1`, sets indicator 51, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR1`.
       - If `BOX2 = 3`, sets indicator 53, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR3`.
       - If `BOX2 = 6`, sets indicator 56, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR6`.
     - For 1099-NEC (indicator 34):
       - If `BOX1 = 1`, sets indicator 47, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR1`.
       - If `BOX2 = 1`, sets indicator 57, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR1`.
   - Moves `VNAMT1` to `VXAMT1` and `VNAMT2` to `VXAMT2` for output.
   - Increments `RECSEQ` and writes a Payee "B" record (`EXCPT ADDB`).

6. **End of Payer Processing (L1 Indicator)**:
   - At level 1 break, increments `RECSEQ` and writes an End of Payer "C" record (`EXCPT ADDL1`) with payee count (`COUNT`) and control totals (`TOTGR1`, `TOTGR2`, `TOTGR3`, `TOTGR6`, `TOTGR7`).

7. **End of Transmission (LR Indicator)**:
   - At last record, increments `RECSEQ` and writes an End of Transmission "F" record (`EXCPT ADDLR`) with the count of Payer "A" records (`TOTA`).

8. **Output Records**:
   - **Transmitter "T" Record** (`ADDT`):
     - Includes `YEAR`, `ID1`, `ID2`, `HEAD1`, `HEAD2`, `HDCITY`, `HDSTAT`, `HDZIP`, `CNTACT`, `CNTPH#`, `TOTB`, `RECSEQ`, and fixed codes (e.g., `28Q01`, `I` for in-house software).
   - **Payer "A" Record** (`ADDA`):
     - Includes `YEAR`, `ID1`, `ID2`, `TYPE`, `HEAD1`, `HEAD2`, `HDCITY`, `HDSTAT`, `HDZIP`, `CNTPH#`, `RECSEQ`, and form-specific codes (e.g., `12` for DIV, `1` for INT, `13` for MISC, `1` for NEC).
   - **Payee "B" Record** (`ADDB`):
     - Includes `YEAR`, `NAM4`, tax ID (`VNID11`, `VNID12`, `VNID13` or `VNID21`, `VNID22`), `VNVEND`, `PYN1`, `PYN2`, `VNADD1`, `CITY`, `STATE`, `ZIP5`, payment amounts (`VXAMT1`, `VXAMT2`), and `RECSEQ`.
   - **End of Payer "C" Record** (`ADDL1`):
     - Includes `COUNT` and control totals (`TOTGR1`, `TOTGR2`, `TOTGR3`, `TOTGR6`, `TOTGR7`).
   - **End of Transmission "F" Record** (`ADDLR`):
     - Includes `TOTA` and `RECSEQ`.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules for IRS 1099 file creation:
1. **Form Type Mapping**:
   - `VN1099 = 'D'` → 1099-DIV (`TYPE = '1 '`), amounts in `TOTGR1` (Ordinary Dividends) and `TOTGR2` (Capital Gains).
   - `VN1099 = 'I'` → 1099-INT (`TYPE = '6 '`), amounts in `TOTGR1` (Interest Income).
   - `VN1099 = 'M'` → 1099-MISC (`TYPE = 'A '`), amounts in:
     - `TOTGR1` for `BOX1 = 1` (Rents) or `BOX2 = 1`.
     - `TOTGR3` for `BOX1 = 3` (Other Income) or `BOX2 = 3`.
     - `TOTGR6` for `BOX1 = 6` (Medical) or `BOX2 = 6`.
   - `VN1099 = 'N'` → 1099-NEC (`TYPE = 'NE'`), amounts in `TOTGR1` for `BOX1 = 1` or `BOX2 = 1`.
2. **Name Handling**:
   - Uses `VNPYN1` and `VNPYN2` if provided; otherwise, uses `VNNAME`.
   - If `VNNOVF = 'Y'`, `VNADD1` becomes `PYN2`, and `VNADD2` shifts to `VNADD1`.
   - `NAM4` (name control) uses `VNNMCT` if available, else `VNNAM4`, or blanks if payee names are used.
3. **Tax ID Handling**:
   - If `VNDASH = '-'`, uses EIN (`VNID21`, `VNID22`); otherwise, uses SSN (`VNID11`, `VNID12`, `VNID13`).
   - `VNVEND` is used as the account number (revision JB03).
4. **Amount Splitting**:
   - `VNAMT1` is assigned to the primary box (`BOX1`) on the 1099 form.
   - If `VNAMT2` exists, it’s assigned to the secondary box (`BOX2`) for 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC.
   - Example: If a vendor has $15,000 total, with $10,000 for MISC (`BOX1 = 7`) and $5,000 for Rents (`BOX2 = 1`), `VNAMT1 = 15,000`, `VNAMT2 = 5,000`, and the program calculates $10,000 for MISC.
5. **Record Sequencing**:
   - Each record (`T`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `F`) includes a unique `RECSEQ` incremented for IRS tracking.
6. **IRS Format Compliance**:
   - Records are padded with zeros or blanks as per IRS specifications (e.g., positions 376–748 for `T` and `A`, 663–750 for `B`).
   - Fixed codes (e.g., `28Q01` for `T`, `AMER` for `A`) ensure IRS compatibility.
7. **Zero-Filled Fields**:
   - Numeric fields (e.g., payment amounts, control totals) are zero-filled if unused (revision JB02).
8. **Form Support**:
   - Supports 1099-DIV, 1099-INT, 1099-MISC, and 1099-NEC (added in revision MG04).

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files/tables:
1. **AP781**:
   - Input file (320 bytes).
   - Contains vendor data including 1099 code, vendor number, name, address, tax ID, and payment amounts.
2. **AP1099**:
   - Output file (750 bytes).
   - Stores the IRS 1099 file with `T`, `A`, `B`, `C`, and `F` records.

### External Programs Called

The `AP780` program does not explicitly call any external programs. It is invoked by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) and processes data from `AP781` to produce `AP1099`.

### Summary

The `AP780` RPG/36 program generates an IRS-compliant 1099 file by:
- Creating a Transmitter "T" record with company and contact details.
- Processing vendor records from `AP781` to create Payer "A" and Payee "B" records, handling form types (DIV, INT, MISC, NEC) and payment amounts.
- Managing payee names, address overflow, and tax IDs (EIN/SSN).
- Accumulating control totals and writing End of Payer "C" and End of Transmission "F" records.
- Ensuring IRS format compliance with zero-filled and blank-filled fields, record sequencing, and specific codes.

The program uses `AP781` as input and `AP1099` as output, with no external program calls, and enforces strict business rules for IRS 1099 compliance.
