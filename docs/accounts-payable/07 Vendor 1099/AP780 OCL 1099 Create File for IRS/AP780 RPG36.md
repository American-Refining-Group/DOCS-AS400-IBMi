The provided document, `AP780.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG (Report Program Generator) program for an IBM System/3x or AS/400 system, called by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) to finalize the creation of an IRS 1099 file (`AP1099`) for electronic submission. This program processes the preprocessed vendor data from the `AP781` file to generate IRS-compliant records, including Transmitter ("T"), Payer ("A"), Payee ("B"), End of Payer ("C"), and End of Transmission ("F") records. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, external programs called, and outputs of the `AP780` RPG program.

### Process Steps of the AP780 RPG Program

The `AP780` program reads the `AP781` file, which contains consolidated vendor records, and generates a formatted `AP1099` file with IRS-specified record types. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Program Initialization (ONCE Block)**:
   - The program checks if the `ONCE` variable is zero (first execution):
     - Initializes counters and fields:
       - `RECSEQ` (record sequence number, 8 digits): Set to zero (JB02 revision).
       - `ZERO03`, `ZERO04`, `ZERO06`, `ZERO12`, `ZERO15` (zero-filled fields of various lengths): Set to zero.
       - `Z1` (1-digit zero): Set to zero.
       - `BLNK04`, `BLNK05`, `BLNK06`, `BLNK07`, `BLNK08`, `BLNK10`, `BLNK11`, `BLNK15`, `BLNK20`, `BLNK40`, `BLNK45`, `BLNK48`, `BLNK60`, `BLNK76`, `BLN115` (blank fields of various lengths): Set to blanks.
     - Increments `RECSEQ` by 1 for the first record.
     - Writes the **Transmitter "T" Record** to `AP1099` using the `ADDT` exception output (see Outputs section for details).
     - Sets `ONCE` to 1 to prevent re-execution.
   - The "T" record contains transmitter information (e.g., company name, tax ID, contact details) and is written once at the start of the file.

2. **Process Vendor Records (L1 Level Loop)**:
   - For each vendor record in `AP781` (grouped by vendor using level-break `L1`):
     - Initializes variables:
       - Increments `TOTA` (count of Payer "A" records, 8 digits) by 1.
       - Resets `COUNT` (count of Payee "B" records for the current payer, 8 digits) to zero.
       - Resets control totals (`TOTGR1`, `TOTGR2`, `TOTGR3`, `TOTGR6`, `TOTGR7`, 15 digits, 2 decimals) to zero.
       - Clears `TYPE` (2 characters, form type) to blanks (FL01 revision).
       - Turns off indicators 31, 32, 33, 34 (form type indicators), and 41, 46, 47, 51, 56, 57 (box-specific indicators).
     - Determines the 1099 form type based on `VN1099` (A/P 1099 code, position 2):
       - If `VN1099 = 'D'` (Dividend):
         - Sets `TYPE = '1 '` (1099-DIV, FL01).
         - Sets indicator 31 on.
       - If `VN1099 = 'I'` (Interest):
         - Sets `TYPE = '6 '` (1099-INT, FL01).
         - Sets indicator 32 on.
       - If `VN1099 = 'M'` (Miscellaneous):
         - Sets `TYPE = 'A '` (1099-MISC, FL01).
         - Sets indicator 33 on.
       - If `VN1099 = 'N'` (Non-Employee Compensation):
         - Sets `TYPE = 'NE'` (1099-NEC, FL01, added by MG04).
         - Sets indicator 34 on.
     - Increments `RECSEQ` by 1 (JB02).
     - Writes the **Payer "A" Record** to `AP1099` using the `ADDA` exception output, containing payer information (e.g., company name, tax ID, form type).
     - Processes payee data:
       - Handles name and payee logic (JB02, JB03, JK01 revisions):
         - Clears `NAM4` (name control, 4 characters) and `PYN1`, `PYN2` (payee names, 40 characters each).
         - Sets `NAM4` to `VNNMCT` (IRS name control, JK01).
         - If `VNPYN1` (payee name 1) is blank:
           - If `NAM4` is blank, sets `NAM4` to `VNNAM4` (sort abbreviation).
           - Sets `PYN1` to `VNNAME` (vendor name).
           - If `VNNOVF = 'Y'` (name overflow, JB03):
             - Sets `PYN2` to `VNADD1` (address line 1 as name continuation).
             - Moves `VNADD2` to `VNADD1`, clears `VNADD2`.
             - Sets indicator 72 on.
         - If `VNPYN1` is not blank:
           - If `NAM4` is blank, sets `NAM4` to `VNNAM4`.
           - Sets `PYN1` to `VNPYN1`, sets indicator 71 on.
           - If `VNPYN2` is not blank, sets `PYN2` to `VNPYN2`, sets indicator 72 on.
       - Checks tax ID type (`VNDASH`, position 119):
         - If `VNDASH = '-'` (indicator 20 on), indicates a business EIN; otherwise, assumes an individual SSN.
       - Accumulates control totals based on form type and box numbers:
         - For 1099-DIV (indicator 31):
           - Adds `VNAMT1` (first box amount) to `TOTGR1` and `TOTGR2`.
         - For 1099-INT (indicator 32):
           - Adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR1`.
         - For 1099-MISC (indicator 33):
           - If `BOX1 = 1` (Rents), sets indicator 41, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR1`.
           - If `BOX1 = 3` (Other Income), sets indicator 43, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR3`.
           - If `BOX1 = 6` (Medical Payments), sets indicator 46, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR6`.
           - If `BOX2 = 1` (Rents), sets indicator 51, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR1`.
           - If `BOX2 = 3` (Other Income), sets indicator 53, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR3`.
           - If `BOX2 = 6` (Medical Payments), sets indicator 56, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR6`.
         - For 1099-NEC (indicator 34):
           - If `BOX1 = 1` (Nonemployee Compensation), sets indicator 47, adds `VNAMT1` to `TOTGR1`.
           - If `BOX2 = 1`, sets indicator 57, adds `VNAMT2` to `TOTGR1`.
       - Copies `VNAMT1` and `VNAMT2` to `VXAMT1` and `VXAMT2` (12 digits, 2 decimals) for output.
       - Increments `RECSEQ` by 1 (JB02).
       - Writes the **Payee "B" Record** to `AP1099` using the `ADDB` exception output, containing vendor details (e.g., tax ID, name, address, payment amounts).
     - Increments `RECSEQ` by 1 (JB02).
     - Writes the **End of Payer "C" Record** to `AP1099` using the `ADDL1` exception output, summarizing the number of payees (`COUNT`) and control totals (`TOTGR1`, `TOTGR3`, `TOTGR6`, `TOTGR7`).

3. **End of Transmission (LR Indicator)**:
   - When the last record is processed (`LR` indicator on):
     - Increments `RECSEQ` by 1 (JB02).
     - Writes the **End of Transmission "F" Record** to `AP1099` using the `ADDLR` exception output, indicating the total number of Payer "A" records (`TOTA`) and closing the file.

### Business Rules

The `AP780` program enforces the following business rules for IRS 1099 file creation:
1. **IRS Record Structure**:
   - Generates a file with five record types per IRS specifications:
     - **T Record**: One per file, containing transmitter information (company name, tax ID, contact, etc.).
     - **A Record**: One per 1099 form type (DIV, INT, MISC, NEC), containing payer information.
     - **B Record**: One per vendor, containing payee details (tax ID, name, address, payment amounts).
     - **C Record**: One per Payer "A" record, summarizing payee count and control totals.
     - **F Record**: One per file, marking the end of transmission.
   - Each record is 750 bytes, padded with blanks or zeros as required.

2. **Form Type Mapping**:
   - Maps `VN1099` codes to IRS form types:
     - `'D'` → 1099-DIV (`TYPE = '1 '`, indicator 31).
     - `'I'` → 1099-INT (`TYPE = '6 '`, indicator 32).
     - `'M'` → 1099-MISC (`TYPE = 'A '`, indicator 33).
     - `'N'` → 1099-NEC (`TYPE = 'NE'`, indicator 34, added by MG04).
   - Supports multiple form types in a single file, with separate "A" and "C" records for each.

3. **Payment Amount Allocation**:
   - Allocates payment amounts (`VNAMT1`, `VNAMT2`) to IRS-specified boxes based on `BOX1` and `BOX2`:
     - 1099-MISC: Box 1 (Rents), Box 3 (Other Income), Box 6 (Medical Payments), Box 7 (Nonemployee Compensation).
     - 1099-NEC: Box 1 (Nonemployee Compensation).
     - 1099-DIV: Box 1 (Ordinary Dividends), Box 2 (Capital Gains).
     - 1099-INT: Box 1 (Interest Income).
   - Accumulates control totals (`TOTGR1`, `TOTGR3`, `TOTGR6`) for specific boxes in the "C" record.

4. **Tax ID Handling**:
   - Identifies tax ID type based on `VNDASH` (`'-'` for EIN, otherwise SSN).
   - Formats tax ID (`VNID11`, `VNID12`, `VNID13` for SSN; `VNID21`, `VNID22` for EIN) in the "B" record.
   - Uses transmitter and payer tax IDs (`ID1`, `ID2`) from `UDS` for "T" and "A" records.

5. **Name and Payee Logic**:
   - Prefers payee names (`VNPYN1`, `VNPYN2`) over vendor name (`VNNAME`) if provided (JB02).
   - Uses name overflow (`VNNOVF = 'Y'`) to continue vendor name with address line 1 (`VNADD1`) in `PYN2`, shifting `VNADD2` to `VNADD1` (JB03).
   - Uses IRS name control (`VNNMCT`, JK01) or sort abbreviation (`VNNAM4`) in `NAM4` for "B" records, ensuring IRS compliance.

6. **Sequence Numbering**:
   - Assigns a unique sequence number (`RECSEQ`) to each record ("T", "A", "B", "C", "F"), incremented sequentially (JB02).

7. **Zero and Blank Padding**:
   - Fills unused numeric fields with zeros (e.g., `ZERO12` for payment amounts) and unused character fields with blanks (e.g., `BLNK40`) per IRS requirements (JB02).
   - Ensures fixed-length records (750 bytes) with proper padding.

8. **IRS Compliance**:
   - Includes fields like name control, foreign entity indicators, and contact information to meet IRS electronic filing standards.
   - Supports 1099-NEC (added by MG04 in 2021) alongside 1099-MISC, 1099-DIV, and 1099-INT.

### Tables Used

- **None**: The `AP780` program does not use any table files (e.g., `GSTABL` as used in `AP780P`). It relies entirely on the input file `AP781` and user data structure (`UDS`) for processing.

### External Programs Called

- **None**: The `AP780` program does not call any external RPG or OCL programs. It is invoked by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) and performs its tasks independently, reading from `AP781` and writing to `AP1099`.
