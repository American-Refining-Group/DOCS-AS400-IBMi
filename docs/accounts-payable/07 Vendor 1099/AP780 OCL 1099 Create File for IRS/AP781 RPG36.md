The `AP781.rpg36.txt` is an RPG/36 program invoked by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) to preprocess Accounts Payable (A/P) vendor data for IRS 1099 file creation. It consolidates vendor data from the `APVEND` file, using the sorted `AP780S` file to ensure one record per vendor, and produces the `AP781` output file for further processing by `AP780`. Below, I’ll detail the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.


### Process Steps of the AP781 RPG Program

The `AP781` program processes sorted vendor data from the `AP780S` file and the original vendor file `APVEND` to create a consolidated output file `AP781`, which is used in subsequent steps to generate the IRS 1099 file. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - The program defines input files `APVEND` (primary vendor file) and `AP780S` (sorted input file), and an output file `AP781`.
   - It uses level-break logic (`L1`) to process records grouped by vendor, ensuring one output record per vendor.
   - Initializes working fields (`L1AMT1`, `L1AMT2`, `BOX1`, `BOX2`) to zero at the start of each vendor group (`L1` level) using `Z-ADD*ZEROS`.

    - **Files**:
     - `APVEND`: Primary input file (579 bytes, indexed), containing vendor data.
     - `AP780S`: Secondary input file (30 bytes, indexed by 3-byte key), used to identify vendors for processing.
     - `AP781`: Output file (320 bytes), storing consolidated vendor data.
   - **Input Record (APVEND)**:
     - `VNDEL` (1): Delete code.
     - `VNCO` (2–3): Company number.
     - `VNVENDL1` (4–8): Vendor number.
     - `VNNAME` (9–38): Vendor name.
     - `VNADD1` (39–68): Address line 1.
     - `VNADD2` (69–98): Address line 2.
     - `VNADD3` (99–128): Address line 3.
     - `VNADD4` (129–158): Address line 4.
     - `VNZIP5` (159–163, zoned): 5-digit ZIP code.
     - `VNSRT4` (168–171): Alpha sort abbreviation.
     - `VNNOVF` (216): Name overflow indicator (`Y` if address used for name continuation).
     - `VNYTDP` (242–247, packed): Current year-to-date paid amount.
     - `VNLYDP` (248–253, packed): Last year-to-date paid amount.
     - `VN1099L2` (264): 1099 code (`D`, `I`, `M`, `N`).
     - `VNID#` (265–275): 1099 tax ID.
     - `VNBOX1` (276–277, zoned): First 1099 box number.
     - `VNBOX2` (278–279, zoned): Second 1099 box number.
     - `VNB2AM` (280–285, packed): Second 1099 box amount.
     - `VNPYN1` (300–339): Payee name 1.
     - `VNPYN2` (340–379): Payee name 2.
     - `VNNMCT` (380–383): IRS name control.
     - `VNFNAM` (418–437): First name.
     - `VNMNAM` (438–457): Middle name.
     - `VNLNAM` (458–487): Business/last name.
     - `VNSUFF` (488–491): Name suffix.
   - **Data Structures**:
     - `ADD2` (30): Temporary field for address processing.
     - `CITY` (1–20): Extracted city name.
     - `CTY` (1–20): Temporary city field.
     - `STATE` (2): Extracted state code.
   - **User Data Structure (UDS)**:
     - `ENTAMT` (111–118, zoned): Entered amount threshold.
     - `CURLST` (123): Current (`C`) or last (`L`) year indicator.
     - `TOTB` (201–208, zoned): Total count of records written.
   - **External Description**:
     - `AP780S` links to `APVEND` for matching vendor records.

2. **Extract State and City (GETSTA Subroutine)**:
   - For each vendor record (`L1` level), the program calls the `GETSTA` subroutine to parse the city and state from the vendor’s address fields (`VNADD2`, `VNADD3`, or `VNADD4`).
   - **Logic**:
     - Clears `STATE`, `CITY`, and `ADD2` fields to blanks.
     - Checks address fields in reverse priority (`VNADD4`, `VNADD3`, `VNADD2`) for non-blank values, copying the first non-blank field to `ADD2`.
     - If no address fields are found, skips to `ENDSTA`.
     - Parses `ADD2` to extract the state:
       - Reads backward from position 30 to find the first letter (A-Z), which is assumed to be the start of the state code (e.g., "PA").
       - Extracts the state (2 characters) into `STATE`.
     - Parses `ADD2` to extract the city:
       - Reads backward from the state’s position to find a space or comma, marking the end of the city.
       - Copies characters from the start of `ADD2` to the delimiter into `CTY` (city field).
   - **Output**: Populates `STATE` (2 characters) and `CITY` (20 characters) for use in the output record.

3. **Determine Payment Amount Based on CURLST**:
   - Checks the `CURLST` field (from the user data structure `UDS`, set by `AP780P` as `'C'` or `'L'`):
     - If `CURLST = 'C'` (current year), adds `VNYTDP` (this year’s year-to-date paid, positions 242-247) to `L1AMT1`.
     - If `CURLST = 'L'` (last year), adds `VNLYDP` (last year’s year-to-date paid, positions 248-253) to `L1AMT1`.
   - Adds `VNB2AM` (second 1099 box amount, positions 280-285) to `L1AMT2`.

4. **Assign 1099 Box Numbers**:
   - If `BOX1` is zero, sets it to `VNBOX1` (first 1099 box number, positions 276-277).
   - If `BOX2` is zero, sets it to `VNBOX2` (second 1099 box number, positions 278-279).
   - This ensures the box numbers from the vendor file are used unless already set.

5. **Validate and Adjust Payment Amounts**:
   - Compares `L1AMT1` (total payment amount) to `ENTAMT` (entered amount from `UDS`, set by `AP780P`).
   - If `L1AMT1` is greater than or equal to `ENTAMT` (indicator 50 on):
     - If `BOX1` is zero, sets it to 7 (default IRS box for 1099-MISC nonemployee compensation).
     - If `L1AMT2` (second box amount) is greater than zero and `BOX2` is non-zero:
       - Subtracts `L1AMT2` from `L1AMT1` to allocate the second box amount separately.
     - Increments `TOTB` (total count, positions 201-208 in `UDS`) by 1 to track valid records.
     - Writes the output record to `AP781` using the `L1ADD` exception output (`EXCPTL1ADD`).

6. **Write Output Record to AP781**:
   - When a valid record is processed (indicator 50 on), the program writes a record to the `AP781` file with the following fields:
     - Record Identification: `'A'` (position 1, constant).
     - `VN1099` (1099 code, position 2, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNVEND` (vendor number, positions 4-8, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNNAME` (vendor name, positions 9-38, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNADD1` (address line 1, positions 39-68, from `APVEND`).
     - `CITY` (city, parsed from `GETSTA`, positions 69-88).
     - `STATE` (state, parsed from `GETSTA`, positions 89-90).
     - `VNZIP5` (zip code, positions 159-163, from `APVEND`).
     - `L1AMT1` (adjusted payment amount, positions 94-102, 9 digits, 2 decimals).
     - `L1AMT2` (second box amount, positions 103-111, 9 digits, 2 decimals).
     - `BOX1` (first 1099 box number, positions 112-113).
     - `BOX2` (second 1099 box number, positions 114-115).
     - `VNID#` (tax ID, positions 265-275, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNSRT4` (sort abbreviation, positions 168-171, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNPYN1` (payee name 1, positions 300-339, from `APVEND`, added by JB01).
     - `VNPYN2` (payee name 2, positions 340-379, from `APVEND`, added by JB01).
     - `VNADD2` (address line 2, positions 211-240, from `APVEND`, added by JB02).
     - `VNNOVF` (name overflow, position 241, from `APVEND`, added by JB02).
     - `VNNMCT` (IRS name control, positions 242-245, from `APVEND`, added by JK01).
     - `VNFNAM` (first name, positions 246-265, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNMNAM` (middle name, positions 266-285, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNLNAM` (business/last name, positions 286-315, from `APVEND`).
     - `VNSUFF` (name suffix, positions 316-320, from `APVEND`).

7. **Repeat for Each Vendor**:
   - The program processes each vendor record from `AP780S` and `APVEND`, using level-break logic (`L1`) to group records by vendor, ensuring one output record per vendor regardless of multiple company entries.

### Business Rules

The `AP781` program enforces the following business rules for 1099 preprocessing:
1. **Single Record per Vendor**:
   - Consolidates multiple vendor records (potentially across different companies, as indicated by `VNCO`) into a single record per vendor, using the vendor number (`VNVEND`) as the key, as processed by the sorted `AP780S` file.

2. **Payment Amount Allocation**:
   - Uses `CURLST` (`'C'` for current year, `'L'` for last year) to select the appropriate year-to-date payment amount (`VNYTDP` or `VNLYDP`).
   - Allocates the total payment (`L1AMT1`) and second box amount (`L1AMT2`) separately if a second 1099 box (`VNBOX2`) is specified.
   - Subtracts `L1AMT2` from `L1AMT1` when both boxes are used to avoid double-counting.

3. **Default 1099 Box**:
   - If the first 1099 box (`BOX1`) is zero and the payment amount meets the threshold (`L1AMT1 >= ENTAMT`), sets `BOX1` to 7 (IRS box for nonemployee compensation on 1099-MISC).
   - Retains vendor-specified box numbers (`VNBOX1`, `VNBOX2`) when non-zero.

4. **Threshold Validation**:
   - Only writes output records if the total payment amount (`L1AMT1`) is greater than or equal to the entered amount (`ENTAMT`), ensuring only vendors meeting the IRS reporting threshold (e.g., $600 for 1099-MISC) are included.

5. **Address Parsing**:
   - Extracts state and city from the highest-priority non-blank address field (`VNADD4`, `VNADD3`, or `VNADD2`).
   - Assumes the state is a 2-character code (e.g., "PA") located after the zip code, and the city precedes the state, separated by a space or comma.
   - Handles cases where address fields are blank by skipping city/state extraction.

6. **IRS Data Inclusion**:
   - Includes IRS-specific fields like tax ID (`VNID#`), payee names (`VNPYN1`, `VNPYN2`), name overflow (`VNNOVF`), IRS name control (`VNNMCT`), and individual name components (`VNFNAM`, `VNMNAM`, `VNLNAM`, `VNSUFF`) to comply with IRS 1099 reporting requirements.

7. **Record Tracking**:
   - Increments `TOTB` for each valid vendor record written to `AP781`, likely used for reporting or validation in subsequent steps.

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files/tables:
1. **APVEND**:
   - Primary input file (579 bytes, indexed).
   - Contains vendor data including payment amounts, 1099 codes, tax IDs, and address fields.
2. **AP780S**:
   - Secondary input file (30 bytes, 3-byte key, indexed).
   - Sorted file used to identify unique vendors for consolidation.
3. **AP781**:
   - Output file (320 bytes).
   - Stores consolidated vendor data with extracted city/state, amounts, and box numbers.

### External Programs Called

The `AP781` program does not explicitly call any external programs. It is invoked by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) and processes data from `APVEND` and `AP780S` to produce `AP781`.

### Summary

The `AP781` RPG/36 program preprocesses A/P vendor data by:
- Consolidating vendor records from `APVEND` using `AP780S` to ensure one record per vendor.
- Accumulating payment amounts (`VNYTDP` or `VNLYDP`) based on `CURLST`, splitting amounts if a second box (`VNB2AM`) exists.
- Extracting `CITY` and `STATE` from address fields using the `GETSTA` subroutine.
- Writing records to `AP781` only if the total amount meets the `ENTAMT` threshold, with a default box number of 7 if unspecified.
- Including payee names, name overflow, and IRS name control for IRS compliance.

The program uses `APVEND` and `AP780S` as inputs and `AP781` as output, with no external program calls, and enforces rules to ensure accurate 1099 data for downstream processing by `AP780`.
