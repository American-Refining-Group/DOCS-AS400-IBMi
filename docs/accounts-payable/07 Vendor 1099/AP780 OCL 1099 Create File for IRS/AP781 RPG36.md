The `AP781.rpg36.txt` is an RPG/36 program invoked by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) to preprocess Accounts Payable (A/P) vendor data for IRS 1099 file creation. It consolidates vendor data from the `APVEND` file, using the sorted `AP780S` file to ensure one record per vendor, and produces the `AP781` output file for further processing by `AP780`. Below, I’ll detail the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AP781 RPG/36 Program

The program reads vendor data from `APVEND` and a sorted control file `AP780S`, processes it to consolidate amounts and extract city/state information, and writes a single record per vendor to `AP781`. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **File and Data Structure Definitions**:
   - **Files**:
     - `APVEND`: Primary input file (579 bytes, indexed), containing vendor data.
     - `AP780S`: Secondary input file (30 bytes, indexed by 3-byte key), used to identify vendors for processing.
     - `AP781`: Output file (320 bytes), storing consolidated vendor data.
   - **Input Record (APVEND)**:
     - `VNDEL` (1): Delete code.
     - `VNCO` (2–3): Company number.
     - `VNVENDL1` (4–8): Vendor number.
     - `VNNAME` (9–38): Vendor name.
     - `VNADD1` (39–68): Address line 1.
     - `VNADD2` (69–98): Address line 2.
     - `VNADD3` (99–128): Address line 3.
     - `VNADD4` (129–158): Address line 4.
     - `VNZIP5` (159–163, zoned): 5-digit ZIP code.
     - `VNSRT4` (168–171): Alpha sort abbreviation.
     - `VNNOVF` (216): Name overflow indicator (`Y` if address used for name continuation).
     - `VNYTDP` (242–247, packed): Current year-to-date paid amount.
     - `VNLYDP` (248–253, packed): Last year-to-date paid amount.
     - `VN1099L2` (264): 1099 code (`D`, `I`, `M`, `N`).
     - `VNID#` (265–275): 1099 tax ID.
     - `VNBOX1` (276–277, zoned): First 1099 box number.
     - `VNBOX2` (278–279, zoned): Second 1099 box number.
     - `VNB2AM` (280–285, packed): Second 1099 box amount.
     - `VNPYN1` (300–339): Payee name 1.
     - `VNPYN2` (340–379): Payee name 2.
     - `VNNMCT` (380–383): IRS name control.
     - `VNFNAM` (418–437): First name.
     - `VNMNAM` (438–457): Middle name.
     - `VNLNAM` (458–487): Business/last name.
     - `VNSUFF` (488–491): Name suffix.
   - **Data Structures**:
     - `ADD2` (30): Temporary field for address processing.
     - `CITY` (1–20): Extracted city name.
     - `CTY` (1–20): Temporary city field.
     - `STATE` (2): Extracted state code.
   - **User Data Structure (UDS)**:
     - `ENTAMT` (111–118, zoned): Entered amount threshold.
     - `CURLST` (123): Current (`C`) or last (`L`) year indicator.
     - `TOTB` (201–208, zoned): Total count of records written.
   - **External Description**:
     - `AP780S` links to `APVEND` for matching vendor records.

2. **Main Processing Loop (Level 1, L1)**:
   - For each level 1 break (group by vendor, driven by `AP780S`):
     - Executes the `GETSTA` subroutine to extract `STATE` and `CITY`.
     - Initializes `L1AMT1`, `L1AMT2`, `BOX1`, and `BOX2` to zeros.
     - Accumulates payment amounts based on `CURLST`:
       - If `CURLST = 'C'`, adds `VNYTDP` (current year YTD) to `L1AMT1`.
       - If `CURLST = 'L'`, adds `VNLYDP` (last year YTD) to `L1AMT1`.
     - Adds `VNB2AM` (second box amount) to `L1AMT2`.
     - Sets `BOX1` to `VNBOX1` and `BOX2` to `VNBOX2` if not zero.
     - If `L1AMT1` meets or exceeds `ENTAMT` (threshold):
       - If `BOX1 = 0`, defaults to 7 (Nonemployee Compensation for 1099-MISC).
       - If `L1AMT2 > 0` and `BOX2 > 0`, subtracts `L1AMT2` from `L1AMT1` to split amounts.
       - Increments `TOTB` (record count).
       - Writes an output record to `AP781` (`EXCPT L1ADD`).

3. **GETSTA Subroutine**:
   - Extracts `STATE` and `CITY` from address fields (`VNADD4`, `VNADD3`, `VNADD2`):
     - Checks `VNADD4`, `VNADD3`, `VNADD2` (in that order) for non-blank data, moving the first non-blank to `ADD2`.
     - If all address fields are blank, skips to `ENDSTA`.
     - Reads `ADD2` backwards from position 30 to find the state (first letter between `A` and `Z`).
     - Extracts the state code (2 characters) starting at the found position.
     - Extracts the city by reading backwards from the state position until a space or comma is found, then copies characters from position 1 to the delimiter into `CTY`.
   - Outputs `STATE` and `CITY` for the `AP781` record.

4. **Output Record (L1ADD)**:
   - Writes to `AP781` with:
     - `A` (record identifier).
     - `VN1099` (1099 code).
     - `VNVEND` (vendor number).
     - `VNNAME` (vendor name).
     - `VNADD1` (address line 1).
     - `CITY` (extracted city).
     - `STATE` (extracted state).
     - `VNZIP5` (ZIP code).
     - `L1AMT1` (primary amount).
     - `L1AMT2` (secondary amount).
     - `BOX1` (first box number).
     - `BOX2` (second box number).
     - `VNID#` (tax ID).
     - `VNSRT4` (sort abbreviation).
     - `VNPYN1`, `VNPYN2` (payee names).
     - `VNADD2` (address line 2).
     - `VNNOVF` (name overflow indicator).
     - `VNNMCT` (IRS name control).
     - `VNFNAM`, `VNMNAM`, `VNLNAM`, `VNSUFF` (name components).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules:
1. **Single Record per Vendor**:
   - Consolidates data to produce one record per vendor, regardless of multiple company entries, using `AP780S` to identify unique vendors.
2. **Amount Threshold**:
   - Only writes records to `AP781` if `L1AMT1` (total amount) meets or exceeds `ENTAMT` (threshold from `UDS`).
3. **Amount Splitting**:
   - If a second box amount (`VNB2AM`) exists, it’s assigned to `L1AMT2`, and `L1AMT1` is reduced by `L1AMT2` to reflect the primary box amount.
   - Example: If `VNYTDP = $15,000`, `VNBOX1 = 7` (Nonemployee Compensation), `VNBOX2 = 1` (Rents), and `VNB2AM = $5,000`, then `L1AMT1 = $10,000`, `L1AMT2 = $5,000`.
4. **Default Box Number**:
   - If `BOX1 = 0` and the amount threshold is met, defaults to box 7 (Nonemployee Compensation for 1099-MISC).
5. **Year Selection**:
   - Uses `CURLST` (`C` or `L`) to select `VNYTDP` (current year) or `VNLYDP` (last year) for `L1AMT1`.
6. **City/State Extraction**:
   - Extracts `STATE` and `CITY` from the highest non-blank address field (`VNADD4`, `VNADD3`, `VNADD2`).
   - Assumes state is the last 2 characters before the ZIP code, and city is the text before a space or comma.
7. **Name Handling**:
   - Includes `VNPYN1`, `VNPYN2` (payee names), `VNNOVF` (name overflow), and `VNNMCT` (IRS name control) for downstream processing.

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files/tables:
1. **APVEND**:
   - Primary input file (579 bytes, indexed).
   - Contains vendor data including payment amounts, 1099 codes, tax IDs, and address fields.
2. **AP780S**:
   - Secondary input file (30 bytes, 3-byte key, indexed).
   - Sorted file used to identify unique vendors for consolidation.
3. **AP781**:
   - Output file (320 bytes).
   - Stores consolidated vendor data with extracted city/state, amounts, and box numbers.

### External Programs Called

The `AP781` program does not explicitly call any external programs. It is invoked by the main OCL program (`AP780.ocl36.txt`) and processes data from `APVEND` and `AP780S` to produce `AP781`.

### Summary

The `AP781` RPG/36 program preprocesses A/P vendor data by:
- Consolidating vendor records from `APVEND` using `AP780S` to ensure one record per vendor.
- Accumulating payment amounts (`VNYTDP` or `VNLYDP`) based on `CURLST`, splitting amounts if a second box (`VNB2AM`) exists.
- Extracting `CITY` and `STATE` from address fields using the `GETSTA` subroutine.
- Writing records to `AP781` only if the total amount meets the `ENTAMT` threshold, with a default box number of 7 if unspecified.
- Including payee names, name overflow, and IRS name control for IRS compliance.

The program uses `APVEND` and `AP780S` as inputs and `AP781` as output, with no external program calls, and enforces rules to ensure accurate 1099 data for downstream processing by `AP780`.
