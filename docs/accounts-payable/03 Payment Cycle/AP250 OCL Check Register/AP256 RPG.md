The provided RPG program, `AP256.rpg36.txt`, is executed by the OCL program `AP256.ocl36.txt`, which is called from the main OCL program (`AP250.ocl36.txt`) within an IBM System/36 or AS/400 Accounts Payable (A/P) system. Its purpose is to generate vendor payment detail reports for ACH (Automated Clearing House) vendors, with output directed to four spool files (`REPORT1` to `REPORT4`) that are emailed to vendors. Below, I will explain the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables (files) used**, and **external programs called** based on the RPG code.

### **Process Steps of the AP256 RPG Program**

The `AP256` RPG program processes temporary A/P transaction data (`APDTWS` and `APDTWSC`), retrieves vendor and company information, and generates up to four reports (`REPORT1` to `REPORT4`) containing payment details for ACH vendors, formatted for emailing. Here is a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **Initialization (Level 2 - Company Break)**:
   - At the company level (`L2`, based on `ADCO`):
     - Retrieves the current system date and time using the `TIME` operation, storing it in `TIMDAT` (12 digits).
     - Extracts the date portion into `DATE` (6 digits) and converts it to a year-month-day format (`DATYMD`) by multiplying by `10000.01`.
     - Sets the century prefix (`20` for 2000s) into `DATE8` (8-digit date, e.g., `20YYMMDD`) and moves `DATYMD` into `DATE8`.
     - Chains to the `APCONT` file using the company number (`ADCO`) to retrieve the company name (`ACNAME`).
     - Initializes the page number (`PAGE`) to 0 and a separator line (`SEP`) to `'* '` for report formatting.

2. **Vendor Processing (Level 1 - Vendor Break)**:
   - At the vendor level (`L1`, based on `ADVEND`):
     - Chains to the `APVEND` file using the company/vendor number (`ADCOVN`) to retrieve vendor details (e.g., `VNNAME`, `VNADD1` to `VNADD4`, `VNZIP5`, `VNZPX4`).
     - Chains to the `APDTWSC` file to retrieve the ACH transaction count (`ACECNT`) for the vendor.
     - Chains to the `APVNFMX` file up to four times to retrieve email addresses (`AMEMLA`) for ACH transactions (`AMFMTY = 'ACHE'`):
       - Stores email addresses in `EMALP1` to `EMALP4` for use in `REPORT1` to `REPORT4`.
     - Initializes totals for invoice amount (`L1INV$M`), discount (`L1DIS$M`), and payment (`L1PYM$M`) to zero.
     - Sets indicator `60` based on the vendor type (`VNCAID`):
       - If `VNCAID â‰  'CRUDE'`, `60` is off, using standard messages (`MSG,1` to `MSG,3`).
       - If `VNCAID = 'CRUDE'`, `60` is on, using crude-specific messages (`MSG,4` to `MSG,6`).

3. **Transaction Processing (Indicator 01)**:
   - For each record in the `APDTWS` file (primary input, indicator `01`):
     - Converts the payment date (`ADDATE`) to an 8-digit format (`KYCKDTY`, e.g., `MMDDYYYY`) using century-aware logic (`Y2KCEN`).
     - Formats monetary fields for reporting:
       - Invoice amount (`ADINV$`) to `ADINV$M`.
       - Discount amount (`ADDISC`) to `ADDISCM`.
       - Payment amount (`ADLPAM`) to `ADPYM$M`.
     - Accumulates totals at the vendor level (`L1`):
       - Adds `ADINV$` to `L1INV$M`.
       - Adds `ADDISC` to `L1DIS$M`.
       - Adds `ADLPAM` to `L1PYM$M`.

4. **Report Generation (REPORT1 to REPORT4)**:
   - Generates four reports (`REPORT1` to `REPORT4`), each directed to a different spool file (`OF`, `OG`, `OA`, `OB`) and potentially emailed to different vendor email addresses (`EMALP1` to `EMALP4`):
     - **Headers (Lines 06-28)**:
       - Prints at the vendor level (`L1`, lines 52/53):
         - Current date (`UDATE`, formatted as `MMDDYY`).
         - Company number (`ADCO`) and vendor number (`ADVEND`).
         - Vendor name (`VNNAME`) and address (`VNADD1` to `VNADD4`).
         - Messages based on vendor type:
           - Standard vendors (`N60`): `MSG,1` to `MSG,3` (e.g., "THE INVOICES LISTED BELOW WERE PAID BY ARG THROUGH ACH ON MM/DD/YY.").
           - Crude vendors (`60`): `MSG,4` to `MSG,6` (e.g., "THIS EMAIL IS NOTIFICATION THAT A DEPOSIT WILL BE MADE INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.").
         - Payment date (`KYCKDTY`).
         - Email address (`EMALP1` to `EMALP4`) for the respective report.
     - **Detail Lines (Line 31-33)**:
       - Prints for each `APDTWS` record:
         - Payment date (`KYCKDTY`).
         - Invoice number (`ADINVN`).
         - Invoice amount (`ADINV$M`).
         - Discount amount (`ADDISCM`).
         - Payment amount (`ADPYM$M`).
     - **Totals (Line E 3)**:
       - Prints vendor-level totals at `L1`:
         - `"TOTAL:"`.
         - Total invoice amount (`L1INV$M`).
         - Total discount (`L1DIS$M`).
         - Total payment (`L1PYM$M`).
     - **Continuation Message**:
       - If the report exceeds the page length, prints `"CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE"`.

5. **Completion**:
   - Processes all `APDTWS` records, generating reports for each vendor with ACH transactions.
   - Terminates, returning control to the `AP256.ocl36.txt` OCL program.

### **Business Rules**

The program enforces the following business rules based on its logic and context within the A/P system:

1. **ACH Vendor Reporting**:
   - Generates detailed payment reports for vendors using ACH payments, identified by `AMFMTY = 'ACHE'` in `APVNFMX`.
   - Supports up to four email addresses per vendor (`EMALP1` to `EMALP4`), allowing multiple recipients for payment notifications.

2. **Vendor Type Differentiation**:
   - Distinguishes between standard vendors and crude vendors (`VNCAID = 'CRUDE'`):
     - Standard vendors receive messages `MSG,1` to `MSG,3` (e.g., instructions to send invoices to `acctpayable@amref.com`).
     - Crude vendors receive messages `MSG,4` to `MSG,6` (e.g., notification of deposit with contact details for Ashley Lipps).
   - Indicator `60` controls message selection based on `VNCAID`.

3. **Data Summarization**:
   - Accumulates invoice, discount, and payment amounts at the vendor level (`L1INV$M`, `L1DIS$M`, `L1PYM$M`) for reporting totals.
   - Includes only ACH-related transactions from `APDTWS`, as filtered by `AP256A`.

4. **Date Handling**:
   - Uses century-aware date processing to format payment dates (`ADDATE` to `KYCKDTY`) based on `Y2KCEN` (e.g., `19` or `20` for century).

5. **Report Output**:
   - Produces four reports (`REPORT1` to `REPORT4`), each directed to a separate spool file and potentially emailed to different vendor email addresses.
   - Reports include vendor details, payment details, and totals, formatted for clarity and email delivery.
   - Supports pagination with continuation messages.

6. **File Access**:
   - `APDTWS` is processed sequentially as the primary input file (`IP`).
   - `APDTWSC`, `APVEND`, `APVNFMX`, and `APCONT` are accessed randomly (`IF`, keyed) for reference data.
   - Reports are written to spool files (`LPRINTER`) for printing or emailing.

7. **Integration with A/P Process**:
   - Relies on `APDTWS` and `APDTWSC` being populated by `AP256A` and prior steps in `AP250.ocl36.txt`.
   - Uses `APVEND` and `APCONT` for vendor and company details, and `APVNFMX` for ACH-specific email addresses.

8. **Error Handling**:
   - No explicit error reporting for unmatched records or missing data, assuming valid input from `AP256A`.

### **External Programs Called**

The `AP256` RPG program **does not call any external programs**. It is self-contained, performing all processing within the main logic and level breaks (`L1`, `L2`). It is invoked by the `AP256.ocl36.txt` OCL program.
