The provided RPG program, `AP255.rpg36.txt`, is executed by the main OCL program (`AP250.ocl36.txt`) within an IBM System/36 or AS/400 Accounts Payable (A/P) system. Its primary purpose is to generate a Cash Disbursements Journal and summarize A/P transactions, producing a report and updating a general ledger file. Below, I will explain the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables (files) used**, and **external programs called** based on the RPG code.

### **Process Steps of the AP255 RPG Program**

The `AP255` RPG program processes sorted cash disbursements journal records from `APCDJR`, summarizes A/P transactions, and generates a formatted report (`APPRINT`) while updating a temporary general ledger file (`TEMGEN`). Here is a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **Initialization (Level 4 - Company/Bank G/L Break)**:
   - At the company or bank G/L level (`L4` indicator), the program initializes key variables:
     - Retrieves the current system date and time using the `TIME` operation, storing it in `TIMDAT` (12 digits).
     - Extracts the time portion into `TIME` (6 digits) and the date portion into `DATE` (6 digits).
     - Converts the date to a year-month-day format (`DATYMD`) by multiplying `DATE` by `10000.01` to adjust for century handling.
     - Sets the century prefix (`20` for 2000s) into `DATE8` (8-digit date field, e.g., `20YYMMDD`) and moves `DATYMD` into `DATE8`.
     - Initializes the page number (`PAGE`) to 0.
     - Sets a separator line (`SEP`) to `'* '` for report formatting.
     - Chains to the `APCONT` file using the company number (`CDCONO`) to retrieve company details (e.g., `ACNAME` for company name).
     - Initializes debit (`L4DR`) and credit (`L4CR`) totals to 0 for journal balancing.

2. **Period/Year Validation**:
   - Checks if the year/period field (`CDYYPD`) is non-zero (`N99`).
     - If non-zero, sets indicators `98` and `99` to enable printing of the period/year (`CDPD`, `CDPDYY`) in the report header.

3. **Record Processing Loop**:
   - Processes each record in the `APCDJR` file (primary input, indicator `01`):
     - Identifies the transaction type (`CDCORD`):
       - If `CDCORD = 'D'`, sets indicator `30` (debit transaction).
     - Identifies the journal entry type (`CDTYPE`):
       - If `CDTYPE = 'AP      '`, sets indicator `20` to indicate an A/P transaction that requires summarization.
     - Converts the check date (`CDCKDT`) to an 8-digit format (`CYMD`, e.g., `20YYMMDD`):
       - Multiplies `CDCKDT` by `10000.01` to get `YMD` (6 digits).
       - Extracts the year (`YY`) and compares it to `Y2KCMP` (company century threshold, e.g., `80`).
       - If `YY >= Y2KCMP`, uses `Y2KCEN` (e.g., `19` or `20`) as the century (`CN`).
       - If `YY < Y2KCMP`, increments `Y2KCEN` by 1 (e.g., `20` becomes `21`).
       - Combines `CN` and `YMD` into `CYMD` for reporting.
     - Accumulates the transaction amount (`CDAMT`) into `L1AMT` (level 1 amount) for summarization.

4. **Journal Entry Processing (JRNL Subroutine)**:
   - The `JRNL` subroutine is called for each non-summarized record (`N20`) and for summarized A/P records at the level 1 break (`L1` and `20`):
     - Increments a journal reference number (`JRREF#`) for each entry.
     - Sets the credit/debit code (`CORD`) based on `CDCORD`:
       - If `L1AMT` is negative (`10` set), reverses the sign of `L1AMT` and adjusts `CORD`:
         - If `30` (debit), sets `CORD = 'C'` (credit).
         - If not `30`, sets `CORD = 'D'` (debit).
     - Accumulates amounts:
       - If `CORD = 'D'` (debit, `11` set), adds `L1AMT` to `L4DR` (debit total).
       - If `CORD â‰  'D'` (credit, `N11`), adds `L1AMT` to `L4CR` (credit total).
     - Moves `L1AMT` to `JRAMT` (journal amount) and resets `L1AMT` to 0.

5. **Output to TEMGEN (General Ledger File)**:
   - For non-summarized records (`N20`):
     - Writes a detailed journal entry to `TEMGEN` with:
       - Record type `'A'` (active).
       - Company number (`CDCONO`).
       - G/L number (`CDGLNO`).
       - Journal number (`CDJRNL`).
       - Reference number (`JRREF#`).
       - Credit/debit code (`CORD`).
       - Check number (`CDCHEK`).
       - Description (`CDDESC`).
       - Date (`YMD`).
       - Amount (`JRAMT`, packed).
       - Vendor name (`CDNAME`).
       - Century-adjusted date (`CYMD`).
   - For summarized A/P records (`L1` and `20`):
     - Writes a summarized journal entry to `TEMGEN` with:
       - Record type `'A'`.
       - Company number (`CDCONO`).
       - G/L number (`CDGLNO`).
       - Journal number (`CDJRNL`).
       - Reference number (`JRREF#`).
       - Credit/debit code (`CORD`).
       - Check date (`CDCKDT`).
       - Fixed description `'-SUMMARIZED A/P         '`.
       - Date (`YMD`).
       - Amount (`JRAMT`, packed).
       - Century-adjusted date (`CYMD`).

6. **Output to Cash Disbursements Journal Report (APPRINT)**:
   - At the company level (`L4`):
     - Prints report headers with:
       - Company name (`ACNAME`).
       - Page number (`PAGE`).
       - Date (`DATE`, formatted as `MMDDYY`).
       - Wire transfer description (`WIREDS`, e.g., `'WT*** WIRE TRANSFER ***'`).
       - Title `'CASH DISBURSEMENTS JOURNAL'`.
       - Time (`TIME`, formatted as `HH.MM.SS`).
       - Journal number (`CDJRNL`).
       - Check date (`CDCKDTY`).
       - Period/year (`CDPD`, `CDPDYY`) if `98` is set.
       - Column headings for journal reference, check number, description, vendor name, and debit/credit amounts with G/L numbers.
   - For each non-summarized record (`01` and `N20`):
     - Prints detail lines with:
       - Journal number (`CDJRNL`).
       - Reference number (`JRREF#`).
       - Check number (`CDCHEK`).
       - Description (`CDDESC`).
       - Vendor name (`CDNAME`).
       - G/L number (`CDGLNO`) and amount (`JRAMT`) in debit (`11`) or credit (`N11`) columns.
   - For summarized A/P records (`L1` and `20`):
     - Prints summarized lines with:
       - Journal number (`CDJRNL`).
       - Reference number (`JRREF#`).
       - Check date (`CDCKDTY`).
       - Fixed description `'-SUMMARIZED A/P         '`.
       - G/L number (`CDGLNO`) and amount (`JRAMT`) in debit (`11`) or credit (`N11`) columns.
   - At the end of the company level (`L4`, total time `T 2`):
     - Prints journal totals with:
       - `'JOURNAL TOTALS'`.
       - Total debits (`L4DR`) and credits (`L4CR`).

7. **Completion**:
   - Processes all `APCDJR` records, writing to `TEMGEN` and `APPRINT` as needed.
   - Terminates, returning control to the main OCL program (`AP250.ocl36.txt`).

### **Business Rules**

The program enforces the following business rules based on its logic and context within the A/P system:

1. **Transaction Type Handling**:
   - Processes journal entries based on `CDCORD`:
     - `'D'`: Debit transaction (`30` set).
     - Other values (e.g., `'C'`): Credit transaction.
   - Adjusts negative amounts by reversing the sign and switching the credit/debit code (`CORD`):
     - Negative debit becomes credit (`CORD = 'C'`).
     - Negative credit becomes debit (`CORD = 'D'`).

2. **A/P Summarization**:
   - Summarizes A/P transactions (`CDTYPE = 'AP      '`, `20` set) at the level 1 break (`L1`), consolidating multiple A/P entries into a single journal entry with the description `'-SUMMARIZED A/P         '`.

3. **Journal Balancing**:
   - Accumulates debit (`L4DR`) and credit (`L4CR`) totals at the company level (`L4`) to ensure journal entries balance.
   - Prints totals in the report to verify debit and credit amounts.

4. **Date Handling**:
   - Uses century-aware date processing:
     - Compares the year (`YY`) from `CDCKDT` to `Y2KCMP` (company century threshold).
     - Assigns the century (`Y2KCEN` or `Y2KCEN + 1`) to create `CYMD` (e.g., `20YYMMDD`).
   - Includes both raw (`YMD`) and century-adjusted (`CYMD`) dates in `TEMGEN` output.

5. **Period/Year Reporting**:
   - If the year/period (`CDYYPD`) is non-zero, includes the period (`CDPD`) and year (`CDPDYY`) in the report header (e.g., `'PERIOD XX-XX'`).

6. **General Ledger Integration**:
   - Writes journal entries to `TEMGEN` for integration with the general ledger system, including both detailed and summarized entries.
   - Uses a consistent format with record type `'A'` (active), company number, G/L number, journal number, reference number, and amount.

7. **Report Formatting**:
   - Generates a formatted Cash Disbursements Journal (`APPRINT`) with headers, detail lines, and totals.
   - Includes debit and credit columns with G/L numbers for clarity.
   - Supports wire transfer descriptions (`WIREDS`) for context.

8. **File Access**:
   - `APCDJR` is processed sequentially as the primary input file (`IP`).
   - `APCONT` is accessed randomly (`IC`, keyed) for company details.
   - `TEMGEN` is an output file for general ledger entries.
   - `AP255S` is a table file, likely used for temporary storage or control data.
