The provided document, `AR931.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG program for the IBM System/36, named `AR931`, which generates an Accounts Receivable (A/R) Control File Listing. This program is called from the main OCL script (`AR931P.ocl36.txt`) after user input is validated by the `AR931P` RPGLE program. The `AR931` program reads data from the A/R control file and produces a formatted report on a printer. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and any external programs called, integrating context from the OCL script and the `AR931P` program for a comprehensive understanding.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

The `AR931` program is a straightforward RPG program designed to read records from the A/R control file (`ARCONT`) and print a formatted report. It operates in a simple input-processing-output cycle, with headers and detail lines for each valid record. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Header Specifications**:
     - `H P016 B AR931`: Specifies the program name (`AR931`) with a program number (`P016`) and batch mode (`B`), indicating it’s designed for batch processing.
   - **File Definitions**:
     - `FARCONT IP F 256 256 DISK`: Defines `ARCONT` as the primary input file (256-byte records, disk-based), read sequentially.
     - `FPRINT O F 160 160 OF PRINTER`: Defines `PRINT` as the output file (160-byte records) for printing the report, with overflow indicator `OF`.
   - **Array Definitions**:
     - `E SEP 66 2`: Defines a 2-element array `SEP` with 66 bytes each, used for separator lines (likely asterisks, initialized in the program).
     - `E SEP2 16 2`: Defines a 2-element array `SEP2` with 16 bytes each, used for additional separator lines.
   - **Input Specifications**:
     - `IARCONT NS 01`: Defines the input record format for `ARCONT` with fields:
       - `ACDEL` (1): Delete flag (`'D'` for deleted records).
       - `ACCO` (2-3): Company number (originally 2-30, likely a typo or legacy format; used as 2-3 in output).
       - `ACNAME` (4-33): Company name.
       - `ACARJ#` (34-35): Next A/R journal number.
       - `ACSLJ#` (36-37): Next sales journal number.
       - `ACARGL` (38-45): A/R general ledger number.
       - `ACSLGL` (46-53): Sales general ledger number.
       - `ACDSGL` (54-61): Discount general ledger number.
       - `ACCSGL` (62-69): Cash general ledger number.
       - `ACICGL` (70-77): Intercompany general ledger number.
       - `ACDATE` (78-83): Last aging date.
       - `ACSECR` (84-91): Security code for statements.
       - `ACFINC` (92-96.4): Finance charge percentage (4 decimal places).
       - `ACFNGL` (97-104): Finance general ledger number.
       - `ACFFMO` (105-106): First fiscal month.
       - `ACLMT1` (107-108): Aging bucket 1 upper limit (1-30 days).
       - `ACLMT2` (109-110): Aging bucket 2 upper limit (31-60 days).
       - `ACLMT3` (111-112): Aging bucket 3 upper limit (61-90 days).
       - `ACLMT4` (123-125): Aging bucket 4 upper limit (91-120 days, added in revision JB01).
   - **Variables**:
     - `TIMDAT` (12 bytes), `TIME` (6 bytes), `DATE` (6 bytes): Used to capture and format the system date and time.
     - `PAGE`: Used for page numbering in the report.

2. **Initial Setup (Calculation Specifications)**:
   - `C N11 SETOF 15`: If indicator `11` is off (no overflow), clears the overflow indicator `15`.
   - `C N11 MOVE '* ' SEP`: Initializes the `SEP` array with asterisks for separator lines.
   - `C N11 MOVE '* ' SEP2`: Initializes the `SEP2` array with asterisks for additional separator lines.
   - `C N11 TIME TIMDAT 120`: Retrieves the system date and time into `TIMDAT`.
   - `C N11 MOVELTIMDAT TIME 60`: Moves the time portion to `TIME` (6 bytes).
   - `C N11 MOVE TIMDAT DATE 60`: Moves the date portion to `DATE` (6 bytes).
   - `C N11 SETON 1115`: Sets indicators `11` (control break) and `15` (overflow) to ensure headers are printed at the start.

3. **Report Generation (Output Specifications)**:
   - The program reads `ARCONT` sequentially (as the primary file) and processes each record:
     - **Record Filtering**: Skips records where `ACDEL = 'D'` (deleted records), as implied by standard System/36 practices, though not explicitly coded in the RPG (likely handled by the OCL or `AR931P` validation).
   - **Output to `PRINT`**:
     - **Header Lines (D 103, D 2, D 1)**:
       - Printed when indicator `15` (overflow) is on or at the start (`N15` for first page).
       - `D 103`: Prints page number (`PAGE`) and date (`DATE`) at positions 104-108 and 120-129.
       - `D 2`: Prints the report title ("A/R CONTROL FILE LISTING") and time (`TIME`) at positions 78 and 120-129.
       - `D 1`: Prints separator lines (`SEP`, `SEP2`) and column headers (e.g., "CO#", "COMPANY NAME", "A/R G/L#", etc.) at various positions.
       - `D 1`: Additional headers for "NEXT" (journal numbers), "GL", "FIRST FISCAL MONTH", and "AGING BUCKETS".
     - **Detail Lines (D 3)**:
       - Printed for each non-deleted `ARCONT` record.
       - Outputs fields: `ACCO` (3), `ACNAME` (35), `ACARGL` (45), `ACCSGL` (56), `ACDSGL` (67), `ACICGL` (78), `ACARJ#` (84), `ACSLJ#` (88), `ACFINC2` (96, formatted finance charge), `ACFNGLZ` (105, formatted finance GL), `ACSECR` (114), `ACFFMO` (129), `ACLMT1` (141), `ACLMT2` (145), `ACLMT3` (149), `ACLMT4` (155).
   - **Overflow Handling**: The `OF` indicator triggers header reprinting when the page length (160 characters, likely with a standard line count) is exceeded.

4. **Program Flow**:
   - The RPG cycle automatically reads each `ARCONT` record, processes it, and writes to `PRINT` until end-of-file.
   - Headers are printed at the start of the report and on page overflows.
   - Detail lines are printed for each valid record, showing A/R control data.

### Business Rules

The `AR931` program enforces the following business rules for the A/R Control File Listing:

1. **Report Content**:
   - The report lists all non-deleted records from `ARCONT` (filtered implicitly or by `AR931P`).
   - For each company, it includes:
     - Company number (`ACCO`) and name (`ACNAME`).
     - General ledger numbers for A/R (`ACARGL`), cash (`ACCSGL`), discount (`ACDSGL`), and intercompany (`ACICGL`).
     - Next journal numbers for A/R (`ACARJ#`) and sales (`ACSLJ#`).
     - Finance charge percentage (`ACFINC`), finance GL number (`ACFNGL`), and security code (`ACSECR`).
     - First fiscal month (`ACFFMO`).
     - Aging bucket upper limits: 1-30 days (`ACLMT1`), 31-60 days (`ACLMT2`), 61-90 days (`ACLMT3`), 91-120 days (`ACLMT4`).

2. **Aging Buckets (Revision JB01)**:
   - Per the revision log (dated 04/13/05), aging is based on **invoice date** rather than due date, as modified for PNC Bank.
   - Aging buckets are:
     - 0-30 days (`ACLMT1`).
     - 31-60 days (`ACLMT2`).
     - 61-90 days (`ACLMT3`).
     - 91-120 days (`ACLMT4`).
     - Over 120 days (implicit, not stored in a specific field).
   - This change aligns with financial reporting requirements for tracking receivables by invoice age.

3. **Report Formatting**:
   - The report includes a header with the title, date, time, and page number.
   - Separator lines (`SEP`, `SEP2`) and column headers ensure readability.
   - Fields are positioned at specific columns (e.g., `ACCO` at 3, `ACNAME` at 35) for consistent formatting.

4. **Record Filtering**:
   - Only non-deleted records (`ACDEL ≠ 'D'`) are included, ensuring the report reflects active companies.
   - The `AR931P` program (called earlier in the OCL) validates company selections (`ALL` or specific companies), so `AR931` processes only the selected records.

5. **Output Control**:
   - The number of copies (`KYCOPY`) is set by `AR931P` and passed via the OCL script.
   - The report can be run interactively or submitted to a job queue (`KYJOBQ`), as determined by `AR931P` and the OCL script.

### Tables/Files Used

1. **ARCONT**:
   - **Type**: Primary input file (disk, 256 bytes).
   - **Purpose**: Stores Accounts Receivable control data, including company details, GL numbers, journal numbers, finance charges, and aging bucket limits.
   - **Fields**:
     - `ACDEL`: Delete flag.
     - `ACCO`: Company number.
     - `ACNAME`: Company name.
     - `ACARJ#`, `ACSLJ#`: Journal numbers.
     - `ACARGL`, `ACSLGL`, `ACDSGL`, `ACCSGL`, `ACICGL`: GL numbers.
     - `ACDATE`: Last aging date.
     - `ACSECR`: Security code.
     - `ACFINC`: Finance charge percentage.
     - `ACFNGL`: Finance GL number.
     - `ACFFMO`: First fiscal month.
     - `ACLMT1`, `ACLMT2`, `ACLMT3`, `ACLMT4`: Aging bucket limits.

2. **PRINT**:
   - **Type**: Output file (printer, 160 bytes).
   - **Purpose**: Receives the formatted report output, including headers and detail lines for each `ARCONT` record.

### External Programs Called

The `AR931` program does not explicitly call any external programs using `CALL` operations. However, it is part of a workflow orchestrated by the OCL script (`AR931P.ocl36.txt`):

- **AR931P**:
  - Called before `AR931` in the OCL script (`// LOAD AR931P` and `// RUN`).
  - Validates user input (company selection, job queue, copies) and sets parameters (`KYALCO`, `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`, `KYJOBQ`, `KYCOPY`) used to control `AR931` execution.
  - Not called by `AR931` but provides input parameters via the data area (`UDS`).

- **GSGENIEC** and **SCPROCP**:
  - Called in the OCL script before `AR931P` (`// CALL PGM(GSGENIEC)` and `// SCPROCP`).
  - Likely handle system setup or environment configuration but are not directly referenced in `AR931`.

### Integration with OCL and AR931P

The OCL script (`AR931P.ocl36.txt`) and `AR931P` RPGLE program provide the context for `AR931`:
- **OCL Script**:
  - Loads `AR931P` to collect and validate user input, then either submits `AR931` to a job queue (`// IF ?L'120,1'?/Y JOBQ ?CLIB?,AR931`) or runs it directly (`// ELSE AR931`).
  - Passes the `ARCONT` file and parameters (e.g., `?9?` for library) to `AR931`.
  - Checks for cancellation (`KYCANC = 'CANCEL'`) set by `AR931P`.
- **AR931P**:
  - Validates company selection (`ALL` or specific companies via `KYALCO`, `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`), job queue (`KYJOBQ`), and copies (`KYCOPY`).
  - Populates a company list (`DCO`) and uses `GSCONT` for default settings.
  - Passes validated parameters to `AR931` via the data area (`UDS`).
- **AR931**:
  - Uses the validated parameters to filter `ARCONT` records (e.g., specific companies if `KYALCO = 'CO'`) and generate the report.
  - Runs in batch mode (as implied by `B` in the header) or interactively, based on `KYJOBQ`.

### Summary

- **Process Overview**: `AR931` reads non-deleted records from the `ARCONT` file and generates a formatted A/R Control File Listing on the `PRINT` file. It prints headers (title, date, time, page number) and detail lines for each company, including GL numbers, journal numbers, finance charges, fiscal month, and aging bucket limits (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120 days, per revision JB01).
- **Business Rules**: Includes only active (`ACDEL ≠ 'D'`) records, formats aging by invoice date (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, over 120 days), and uses parameters from `AR931P` for company selection and job control. Ensures consistent report formatting with headers and separators.
- **Files/Tables**: `ARCONT` (input, A/R control data), `PRINT` (output, printer file).
- **External Programs**: None called directly in `AR931`, but `AR931P` (input validation), `GSGENIEC`, and `SCPROCP` (system setup) are part of the OCL workflow.

If you need further details (e.g., specific report layout or additional context about `GSCONT` or `AR931P` interactions), please provide additional files or clarify the requirements, as some aspects (e.g., exact filtering logic) depend on the broader system context.
