The provided document, `AR931P.rpgle.txt`, is an RPGLE (Report Program Generator Language Extended) program for the IBM System/36 or AS/400 (IBM i) environment, converted from an older RPG format by the TARGET/400 tool. This program, `AR931P`, appears to handle the prompting and validation for generating an Accounts Receivable (A/R) Control File List. It interacts with a workstation (display file) to collect user input and validates it against data in the A/R control file. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and any external programs called, referencing the previously provided OCL script (`AR931P.ocl36.txt`) for context.

### Process Steps of the RPGLE Program

The `AR931P` program is designed to prompt the user for parameters (e.g., company selection, job queue settings) via a display file, validate the input, and prepare data for the A/R Control File List report. The steps are executed in a structured flow, with subroutines handling specific tasks. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Header Specifications**:
     - `H DFTACTGRP(*NO)`: Runs the program in a named activation group (not the default), ensuring proper resource management.
     - `H FIXNBR(*ZONED:*INPUTPACKED)`: Ensures zoned and packed decimal fields are handled correctly during input.
     - `H DFTNAME(AR931P)`: Sets the default program name to `AR931P`.
   - **File Definitions**:
     - `FAR931PD CF E WORKSTN HANDLER('PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)')`: Defines the display file `AR931PD` (likely replacing the original `CREEN`) for user interaction, using the Profound UI handler for modernized UI support.
     - `FARCONT IF F 256 2AIDISK KEYLOC(2)`: Defines the input file `ARCONT` (Accounts Receivable control file), with a record length of 256 bytes and a key starting at position 2.
     - `FGSCONT IF F 512 2AIDISK KEYLOC(2)`: Defines another input file `GSCONT`, likely a general system control file, with a record length of 512 bytes and a key at position 2.
   - **Data Structures and Variables**:
     - `COM`: A compile-time array of 5 elements (40 bytes each) containing error messages (e.g., "COMPANY SELECTION MUST BE 'CO' OR 'ALL'").
     - `DCO`: An array of 10 elements (35 bytes each) to store company numbers and names from `ARCONT`.
     - `UDS`: A data structure for passing parameters, including:
       - `KYALCO` (111-113): Company selection code (`ALL` or `CO`).
       - `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3` (114-119): Company numbers (numeric).
       - `KYJOBQ` (120): Job queue flag (`Y` or `N`).
       - `KYCOPY` (121-122): Number of copies for the report.
       - `KYCANC` (129-134): Cancellation flag.
   - **Indicators**: RPG indicators (e.g., `*IN01`, `*IN09`, `*IN81`) control program flow and screen display.

2. **Workstation File Read and Control (`QSCTL` Check)**:
   - The program checks the `QSCTL` variable (likely a control flag):
     - If `QSCTL` is blank:
       - Sets `*IN09 = '1'` and `*IN01 = '0'`.
       - Sets `QSCTL = 'R'` (likely indicating a read operation).
     - Else:
       - Sets `*IN09 = '0'` and `*IN01 = '1'`.
       - Reads the display file `AR931PD` and sets `*INLR = *ON` (last record), then returns, exiting the program.
   - This step determines whether to initialize the screen or process user input.

3. **Clear Messages and Indicators**:
   - Clears the `MSG` field (40 bytes) used for error messages.
   - Resets indicators `*IN51`, `*IN52`, `*IN53`, `*IN54`, `*IN81`, `*IN90` to `*OFF` to ensure a clean state for validation and display.

4. **Cancel Key Check (`*INKG`)**:
   - If the cancel function key (`*INKG = *ON`) is pressed:
     - Resets `*IN01` and `*IN09` to `*OFF`.
     - Sets `*INLR = *ON` to indicate program termination.
     - Sets `KYCANC = 'CANCEL'`, which aligns with the OCL script’s error check (`// IF ?L'129,6'?/CANCEL GOTO END`).
     - This allows the user to cancel the operation, terminating the program.

5. **Initial Setup (`*IN09` Check)**:
   - If `*IN09 = *ON` (initial program entry):
     - Sets `*IN81 = *ON` to control screen display.
     - Executes the `ONETIM` subroutine to perform one-time setup tasks.
   - This ensures setup occurs only on the first pass.

6. **Screen Processing (`*IN01` Check)**:
   - If `*IN01 = *ON` (user input received):
     - Executes the `SCREEN1` subroutine to validate user input.
   - This handles the validation of parameters entered via the display file.

7. **Screen Display or Termination**:
   - If `*IN81 = *OFF`:
     - Sets `*INLR = *ON` to terminate the program.
   - If `*IN81 = *ON`:
     - Writes to the display file `AR931PD` to show the screen (with fields like `KYALCO`, `KYCO1`, `DCO`, etc.) and loops back to the `END` tag for further input.
   - This controls whether the program displays the screen or exits.

8. **ONETIM Subroutine**:
   - **Purpose**: Performs one-time setup, populating the `DCO` array with company data and setting default parameters.
   - **Steps**:
     - Clears the `DCO` array.
     - Initializes counters: `X = 1` (array index), `ACLIM = 00` (limit for reading `ARCONT`).
     - Positions the file pointer at the start of `ARCONT` using `SETLL`.
     - Reads `ARCONT` records in a loop until end-of-file (`*IN10 = *ON`) or `X = 10`:
       - Skips records where `ACDEL = 'D'` (deleted records).
       - Stores `ACCO` (company number) and `ACNAME` (company name) in `DCO(X)`.
       - Increments `X`.
     - Copies `DCO` elements to individual fields (`DCO1` to `DCO10`) for display.
     - Checks `GSCONT` for a company number (`GXCONO`):
       - If `GXCONO ≠ 0`, sets `KYALCO = 'CO '` and `KYCO1 = GXCONO`.
       - Else, sets `KYALCO = 'ALL'`.
     - Sets defaults: `KYJOBQ = 'N'`, `KYCOPY = 01`.
     - Sets `*IN81 = *ON` to display the screen.

9. **SCREEN1 Subroutine**:
   - **Purpose**: Validates user input for company selection, company numbers, and job queue settings.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Company Selection Validation**:
       - Checks if `KYALCO = 'ALL'` or `KYALCO = 'CO '`. If neither, sets error indicators (`*IN81`, `*IN90`), displays error message `COM(1)` ("COMPANY SELECTION MUST BE 'CO' OR 'ALL'"), and jumps to `ENDS1`.
       - If `KYALCO = 'CO'` and all company numbers (`KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`) are `0`, sets error indicators (`*IN81`, `*IN90`, `*IN51`), displays `COM(2)` ("IF CO, THEN ENTER VALID COMPANIES"), and jumps to `ENDS1`.
       - If `KYALCO = 'ALL'` and any company number is non-zero, sets error indicators (`*IN81`, `*IN90`, `*IN51`), displays `COM(3)` ("IF ALL, THEN DO NOT ENTER COMPANIES"), and jumps to `ENDS1`.
     - **Company Number Validation** (if `KYALCO = 'CO'`):
       - For each non-zero `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`, performs a `CHAIN` to `ARCONT` to verify the company number exists.
       - If any company number is invalid (`*IN10 = *ON`), sets error indicators (`*IN81`, `*IN90`, `*IN51`/`IN52`/`IN53`), displays `COM(4)` ("INVALID COMPANY NUMBER"), and jumps to `ENDS1`.
     - **Job Queue Validation**:
       - Checks if `KYJOBQ = 'Y'` or `KYJOBQ = 'N'`. If neither, sets error indicators (`*IN81`, `*IN90`, `*IN54`), displays `COM(5)` ("JOB QUEUE ENTRY MUST BE 'Y' OR 'N'"), and jumps to `ENDS1`.
     - **Copy Count Validation**:
       - If `KYCOPY = 0`, sets it to `01` to ensure at least one copy.
     - Jumps to `ENDS1` to end the subroutine.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules for generating the A/R Control File List:

1. **Company Selection**:
   - The user must select either `ALL` (process all companies) or `CO` (specific companies) via `KYALCO`.
   - If `KYALCO = 'CO'`, at least one valid company number (`KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, or `KYCO3`) must be provided.
   - If `KYALCO = 'ALL'`, no company numbers should be entered.
   - Company numbers must exist in the `ARCONT` file and not be marked as deleted (`ACDEL ≠ 'D'`).

2. **Job Queue Selection**:
   - The job queue flag (`KYJOBQ`) must be either `Y` (submit to job queue) or `N` (run interactively).
   - This aligns with the OCL script’s conditional job submission (`// IF ?L'120,1'?/Y JOBQ ?CLIB?,AR931`).

3. **Copy Count**:
   - The number of report copies (`KYCOPY`) must be at least 1. If set to 0, it defaults to 1.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid inputs (e.g., wrong `KYALCO`, invalid company numbers, or incorrect `KYJOBQ`) trigger error messages from the `COM` array and prevent further processing until corrected.
   - The cancel key (`*INKG`) allows the user to exit, setting `KYCANC = 'CANCEL'`, which the OCL script checks to terminate the job.

5. **Data Validation**:
   - Only non-deleted records (`ACDEL ≠ 'D'`) from `ARCONT` are used.
   - Up to 10 companies can be displayed (`DCO` array), populated from `ARCONT`.

6. **Default Settings**:
   - If `GSCONT` contains a non-zero company number (`GXCONO`), it defaults to `KYALCO = 'CO '` with `KYCO1 = GXCONO`. Otherwise, `KYALCO = 'ALL'`.
   - `KYJOBQ` defaults to `N`, and `KYCOPY` defaults to `01`.

### Tables/Files Used

1. **AR931PD**:
   - Type: Display file (workstation file).
   - Purpose: Handles user interaction, displaying prompts for `KYALCO`, `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`, `KYJOBQ`, `KYCOPY`, `DCO` (company list), and `MSG` (error messages).
   - Uses the Profound UI handler for modernized display.

2. **ARCONT**:
   - Type: Input file (disk, 256 bytes, indexed).
   - Purpose: Stores Accounts Receivable control data, including:
     - `ACDEL` (position 1): Delete flag (`'D'` for deleted).
     - `ACCO` (positions 2-3): Company number.
     - `ACNAME` (positions 4-33): Company name.
   - Used to validate company numbers and populate the `DCO` array.

3. **GSCONT**:
   - Type: Input file (disk, 512 bytes, indexed).
   - Purpose: Stores system control data, including:
     - `GXDEL` (position 1): Delete flag.
     - `GXCONO` (positions 77-78): Company number.
   - Used to determine the default company selection (`KYALCO` and `KYCO1`).

### External Programs Called

The RPGLE program does not explicitly call any external programs using `CALL` operations. However, the OCL script (`AR931P.ocl36.txt`) provides context for how `AR931P` fits into the workflow:

- **AR931**:
  - Referenced in the OCL script (`// IF ?L'120,1'?/Y JOBQ ?CLIB?,AR931` or `// ELSE AR931`).
  - Likely an RPG program or job that generates the actual A/R Control File List report, using parameters validated by `AR931P`.
  - Not called directly from the RPGLE code but is part of the job flow.

- **GSGENIEC** and **SCPROCP**:
  - Called in the OCL script before `AR931P` is loaded.
  - Not referenced in the RPGLE code but part of the broader job setup.

### Integration with OCL Script

The OCL script (`AR931P.ocl36.txt`) orchestrates the execution of `AR931P`:
- It loads and runs `AR931P` with the `ARCONT` file.
- It checks `KYCANC` (positions 129-134) for `'CANCEL'` to terminate if the user cancels.
- It uses `KYJOBQ` (position 120) to decide whether to queue `AR931` (`Y`) or run it directly (`N`).
- The `?9?` parameter in the OCL script aligns with file labels and library references.

### Summary

- **Process Overview**: `AR931P` prompts the user for company selection (`ALL` or specific companies), company numbers, job queue settings, and report copies via a display file (`AR931PD`). It validates inputs against `ARCONT` and `GSCONT`, populates a company list, and sets parameters for the OCL script to control further job execution (e.g., running `AR931`). It handles errors with appropriate messages and allows cancellation.
- **Business Rules**: Enforces valid company selection (`ALL` or `CO`), valid company numbers, correct job queue settings (`Y` or `N`), and a minimum of one report copy. Uses `GSCONT` for defaults and skips deleted records in `ARCONT`.
- **Files/Tables**: `AR931PD` (display), `ARCONT` (A/R control data), `GSCONT` (system control data).
- **External Programs**: None called directly in RPGLE, but `AR931` (report generation), `GSGENIEC`, and `SCPROCP` are part of the OCL workflow.
