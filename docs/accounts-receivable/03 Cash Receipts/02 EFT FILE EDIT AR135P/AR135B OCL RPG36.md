The provided documents include an OCL program (`AR135B.ocl36.txt`) and an RPG program (`AR135B.rpg36.txt`) that are part of the Accounts Receivable (AR) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) draft automation process. The OCL program loads and runs the RPG program, which processes EFT transaction data to produce a report or update transaction records. Below, I will explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called for both the OCL and RPG programs.

### Process Steps of the AR135B OCL Program

The OCL program (`AR135B.ocl36.txt`) is a simple script that sets up and executes the `AR135B` RPG program. Here are the steps:

1. **Comment Block**:
   ```
   **
   ** EFT CUSTOMER(S) ACCCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE REPORT
   ** PRINTS THE EFT REPORT (ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER FOR EACH EFT CUSTOMER)
   **
   ```
   - This describes the purpose: generating a report for EFT customers’ Accounts Receivable due amounts, likely listing transactions or summaries for EFT processing.

2. **Load Program `AR135B`**:
   ```
   // LOAD AR135B
   ```
   - Loads the `AR135B` RPG program into memory for execution.

3. **Define File `CRTRAN`**:
   ```
   // FILE NAME-CRTRAN,LABEL-?9?E?L'110,6'?,DISP-SHR
   ```
   - Specifies the `CRTRAN` file with a dynamic label (`?9?E?L'110,6'?`, e.g., `PRODE123456` if `?9?` is `PROD` and `?L'110,6'?` is `123456`).
   - `DISP-SHR` indicates shared access, allowing concurrent use by other programs or jobs.
   - `CRTRAN` is the EFT transaction workfile containing transaction details.

4. **Run the Program**:
   ```
   // RUN
   ```
   - Executes the loaded `AR135B` RPG program, which processes the `CRTRAN` file to generate the EFT report or update records.

### Process Steps of the AR135B RPG Program

The `AR135B` RPG program is a System/36-style fixed-format RPG program designed to process EFT transactions and update the `CRTRAN` file with date fields. It operates on the `CRTRAN` file and uses data from the User Data Structure (UDS) for control parameters. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the RPG program’s logic:

1. **File and Data Definitions**:
   - **Files**:
     - `CRTRAN` is defined as an update file (`UP`) with a record length of 256 bytes, keyed on position 2 (likely company and customer or sequence).
   - **Input Specifications**:
     - Defines fields in `CRTRAN` such as `ATDEL` (delete flag), `ATCO` (company), `ATCUST` (customer), `ATINV#` (invoice), `ATAMT` (amount), `ATDISC` (discount), `ATTYPE` (type), `ATDATE` (date), `ATGLCR` (credit G/L), `ATGLDR` (debit G/L), `ATDESC` (description), `ATDUDT` (due date), `ATTERM` (terms), `ATCODI` (discount company), `ATGLDI` (discount G/L), `ATCOCR` (credit company), `ATCODR` (debit company), `ATNOD` (notification of difference), and additional date fields (`ADTXCN`, `ADTXYY`, `ADTXMM`, `ADTXDD`, `ADDUD8`, `DISCY`, `DISMD`).
     - `KYSEDT` (positions 234-239) is a key field for the select date.
   - **UDS**:
     - Defines control fields: `KYCO` (company), `STATUS`, `KYUPDT` (update date), `Y2KCEN` (Y2K century), `Y2KCMP` (Y2K comparison).

2. **Main Processing Logic**:
   - The program operates under a condition (`*IN01` indicator, likely set by the OCL or system state).
   - **Conditional Update of Dates**:
     ```
     C   01                DO
     C           KYUPDT    IFNE *ZEROS
     C                     Z-ADDKYUPDT    UPDTSV  60
     C                     END
     C           KYSEDT    IFNE *ZEROS
     C                     Z-ADDKYSEDT    SEDTSV  60
     C                     END
     ```
     - Checks if `KYUPDT` (update date) is non-zero; if so, moves it to `UPDTSV` (a 6-digit save field).
     - Checks if `KYSEDT` (select date) is non-zero; if so, moves it to `SEDTSV` (another 6-digit save field).
   - **Output Record**:
     ```
     C                     EXCPT
     ```
     - Writes or updates a record to `CRTRAN` using the `E` (exception) output specification.

3. **Output Specifications**:
   ```
   OCRTRAN  E
   O                         UPDTSV   233
   O                         SEDTSV   239
   ```
   - Updates the `CRTRAN` file, writing `UPDTSV` to positions 228-233 and `SEDTSV` to positions 234-239.
   - These fields likely represent updated transaction or select dates for EFT processing.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - The program ends after processing the `CRTRAN` record, returning control to the calling OCL program.

The program is simple and focused: it reads control data from UDS, updates date fields in `CRTRAN`, and writes the modified record. It does not interact with a workstation or produce a report directly, despite the OCL comment suggesting a report. The report may be generated by a subsequent program or process (e.g., `AR135A`).

### Business Rules

The OCL and RPG programs enforce the following business rules, inferred from their structure and context:

1. **OCL Program (AR135B.ocl36.txt)**:
   - **Dynamic File Labeling**: Uses `?9?` (e.g., `PROD`) and `?L'110,6'?` (e.g., `123456`) for the `CRTRAN` file label, ensuring flexibility across environments (e.g., production, test).
   - **Shared Access**: Opens `CRTRAN` in shared mode (`DISP-SHR`), allowing concurrent access by other jobs or programs, critical for multi-user EFT processing.
   - **Report Context**: The comment indicates the program supports an EFT report, but the RPG logic suggests `AR135B` updates transaction records, likely preparing data for a report generated elsewhere.

2. **RPG Program (AR135B.rpg36.txt)**:
   - **Date Updates**:
     - Updates `CRTRAN` with `KYUPDT` (update date) and `KYSEDT` (select date) from UDS, only if non-zero.
     - These dates are critical for EFT processing, possibly marking when transactions were processed or selected for transfer.
   - **Conditional Processing**:
     - Only executes if `*IN01` is on, suggesting control by the OCL caller or system state.
     - Checks for non-zero dates to avoid overwriting valid data with blanks.
   - **Data Integrity**:
     - Updates specific fields (`UPDTSV`, `SEDTSV`) in `CRTRAN` without modifying other transaction data (e.g., amount, customer, G/L accounts).
     - Ensures accurate date tracking for EFT transactions.
   - **EFT Context**:
     - Part of EFT draft automation, likely preparing transaction records for downstream processing (e.g., bank file generation or reporting in `AR135A`).

### Tables/Files Used

The programs use the following file:

| File Name | Type | Record Length | Key Location | Usage/Description |
|-----------|------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **CRTRAN** | Update File (UP) | 256 | 2 | EFT transaction workfile; stores transaction details (company, customer, invoice, amount, discount, type, dates, G/L accounts, description). Updated with `UPDTSV` (update date) and `SEDTSV` (select date). |

- **OCL Context**: The file is labeled dynamically (`?9?E?L'110,6'?`, e.g., `PRODE123456`) and opened in shared mode (`DISP-SHR`).
- **RPG Context**: The file is defined with fields for transaction data, including dates (`ATDATE`, `ATDUDT`, `ADDUD8`), G/L accounts, and flags (`ATDEL`, `ATNOD`).

No other files are referenced in either program.

---

### External Programs Called

- **OCL Program (AR135B.ocl36.txt)**:
  - Calls the RPG program `AR135B` via `LOAD` and `RUN`.
  - No other external programs or procedures are invoked.

- **RPG Program (AR135B.rpg36.txt)**:
  - Does not explicitly call any external programs or procedures (no `CALL` operations).
  - Uses internal exception output (`EXCPT`) to update `CRTRAN`.
  - Relies on the calling OCL program for setup and control.

---

### Summary

**OCL Program (`AR135B.ocl36.txt`)**:
- **Process Steps**: Loads `AR135B`, opens `CRTRAN` with a dynamic label in shared mode, and runs the program.
- **Business Rules**: Ensures flexible file access across environments and supports concurrent processing. Prepares for an EFT report, though the RPG logic focuses on data updates.
- **Files Used**: `CRTRAN`.
- **External Programs**: Calls `AR135B`.

**RPG Program (`AR135B.rpg36.txt`)**:
- **Process Steps**: Reads control data from UDS, checks and moves non-zero `KYUPDT` and `KYSEDT` to save fields, updates `CRTRAN` with these dates, and writes the record.
- **Business Rules**: Updates transaction dates for EFT processing, ensuring non-zero values are applied to maintain data integrity. Operates conditionally based on `*IN01`.
- **Files Used**: `CRTRAN`.
- **External Programs**: None.

The `AR135B` programs are a small but critical part of the EFT process, updating transaction dates in `CRTRAN` to prepare for reporting or further processing (likely by `AR135A`). The OCL sets up the environment, while the RPG performs targeted updates. If you need details on `AR135A` or the report output, additional source files would be required.
