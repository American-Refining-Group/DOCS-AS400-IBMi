The provided document, `AR157A.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG III program used in IBM midrange systems (e.g., AS/400, iSeries) to perform field adjustments on an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) cash receipts batch file before its creation. This program is loaded and executed by the `AR157A.ocl36` OCL program, which is part of the EFT cash receipts batch file creation process orchestrated by the `AR157P.ocl36` and `AR157.ocl36` programs. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and external programs called, based on the RPG code.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program (`AR157A`)

The `AR157A` RPG program is designed to process records in the `CRTRAN` file, adjusting fields as needed for the EFT cash receipts batch file. The provided source code is incomplete, as it primarily defines the file structure and input/output specifications but lacks the main program logic (e.g., `C` specs for calculations or updates). However, based on the context and the OCL program (`AR157A.ocl36`), we can infer the steps involved. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - The program header (`H` spec, line 0001) identifies the program as `AR157A` with identifier `P064`.
   - The file `CRTRAN` is defined as an update file (`UP`) with a record length of 256 bytes, stored on disk (`DISK`) (line 0004).
   - Input specifications (`I` specs, lines 0059–0076) define the structure of the `CRTRAN` file, mapping fields such as transaction amount, date, customer number, and more.
   - Output specifications (`O` specs, lines 0123–0132) indicate that the program writes records to `CRTRAN` with at least one field (`KYUPDT`) updated at position 37.

2. **Read and Process `CRTRAN` Records**:
   - The program likely reads each record from the `CRTRAN` file, identified by the input specification `CRTRAN NS 01` (line 0007), which defines a non-sequential read for record type `01`.
   - For each record, the program processes fields such as:
     - `ATDEL` (position 1): Delete flag (`'D'` indicates a deleted record).
     - `ATCO` (positions 7–8): Company number.
     - `ATCUST` (positions 9–14): Customer number.
     - `ATINV#` (positions 15–21): Invoice number.
     - `ATAMT` (positions 22–26, packed): Transaction amount.
     - `ATDISC` (positions 27–30, packed): Transaction discount.
     - `ATDATE` (positions 32–37): Transaction date.
     - `KYUPDT` (positions 228–233): Likely the bank upload date, used as a key or for adjustment.
     - Other fields like G/L accounts, terms, and tax-related fields (`ADTXCN`, `ADTXYY`, etc.).
   - The program likely performs field adjustments, such as updating `KYUPDT` (bank upload date) or other fields to ensure the data is formatted correctly for EFT processing.

3. **Update `CRTRAN` Records**:
   - The output specification `CRTRAN D 01` (line 0123) indicates that the program updates records in the `CRTRAN` file.
   - The field `KYUPDT` is written to positions 37 (line 0126), suggesting that the bank upload date is updated or adjusted in the record.
   - Other fields may also be updated, but the incomplete `C` specs limit visibility into the exact logic.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - After processing all records, the program terminates, leaving the `CRTRAN` file updated and ready for the subsequent copy operation in `AR157.ocl36` (which copies `CRTRAN` to `?9?CRIEGG`).

### Business Rules

Based on the RPG code, the OCL context, and the role of `AR157A` in the EFT cash receipts process, the following business rules are inferred:

1. **Field Adjustment for EFT Compliance**:
   - The program adjusts fields in the `CRTRAN` file to ensure the EFT transaction data is correctly formatted for the cash receipts batch file.
   - A key adjustment involves the `KYUPDT` field (bank upload date), which is written to position 37, ensuring it aligns with the validated upload date from `AR157P.rpgle` (stored at location 110, length 6).

2. **Non-Deleted Records**:
   - The `ATDEL` field (position 1) indicates whether a record is deleted (`'D'`). The subsequent `AR157.ocl36` program filters out records where `ATDEL = 'D'`, so `AR157A` likely ensures this flag is correctly set or preserved.

3. **Dynamic File Naming**:
   - The `CRTRAN` file is dynamically named as `?9?E?L'110,6'?` (e.g., `QS36F/CO123E202311`), where:
     - `?9?` is the company code or batch identifier.
     - `?L'110,6'?` is the bank upload date (`KYUPDT`, e.g., `202311` for November 2023).
   - This ensures the program processes the correct company- and date-specific EFT data.

4. **Shared File Access**:
   - The `CRTRAN` file is opened in shared mode (`DISP-SHR` in `AR157A.ocl36`), allowing concurrent access by other processes, which is critical in a multi-user environment.

5. **Data Integrity**:
   - The program likely validates or adjusts fields like `ATAMT` (transaction amount), `ATDISC` (discount), `ATDATE` (transaction date), and G/L accounts (`ATGLCR`, `ATGLDR`, `ATGLDI`) to ensure they meet EFT or accounting requirements.

### Tables/Files Used

The program interacts with the following file:

1. **CRTRAN**:
   - Type: Update file (`UP`), disk-based, 256 bytes.
   - Physical File Label: `?9?E?L'110,6'?` (e.g., `QS36F/CO123E202311`, where `?9?` is the company code and `?L'110,6'?` is the bank upload date).
   - Library: Likely `QS36F` (based on consistency with `AR157.ocl36`).
   - Disposition: `DISP-SHR` (shared access, as specified in `AR157A.ocl36`).
   - Purpose: Temporary workfile containing EFT individual entry data, which is adjusted by `AR157A` before being copied to the cash receipts batch file (`?9?CRIEGG` in `AR157.ocl36`).
   - Key Fields:
     - `ATDEL` (1): Delete flag.
     - `ATCO` (7–8): Company number.
     - `ATCUST` (9–14): Customer number.
     - `ATINV#` (15–21): Invoice number.
     - `ATAMT` (22–26, packed): Transaction amount.
     - `ATDISC` (27–30, packed): Transaction discount.
     - `ATDATE` (32–37): Transaction date.
     - `KYUPDT` (228–233): Bank upload date (adjusted in output).
     - Other fields for G/L accounts, terms, and tax data.
   - Usage: Read and updated by the program to adjust fields for EFT processing.

### External Programs Called

The `AR157A` RPG program does not explicitly call any external programs, based on the provided code. The incomplete `C` specs (calculation specifications) might include calls to other programs, but none are visible in the source.

---

### Notes
- **Incomplete Code**: The provided RPG source lacks the calculation specifications (`C` specs) that would detail the specific field adjustments. The program likely updates fields like `KYUPDT`, `ATAMT`, or others to ensure EFT compliance, but the exact logic is not visible.
- **Integration with Program Suite**: `AR157A` is loaded by `AR157A.ocl36`, which is called by `AR157.ocl36`, itself invoked by `AR157P.ocl36`. The `?9?` (company code) and `?L'110,6'?` (bank upload date) parameters ensure consistency across the suite.
- **Jan Beccari Change**: The change from `?WS?` to `GG` (noted in `AR157.ocl36` and `AR157P.ocl36`) does not directly affect `AR157A`, but the adjusted `CRTRAN` file is copied to `?9?CRIEGG` in `AR157.ocl36`, reflecting this change.
- **Purpose of Adjustments**: The program likely formats fields for EFT standards (e.g., ACH file requirements) or aligns data with internal AR processes, such as ensuring correct G/L accounts or transaction dates.
- **Shared Access**: The `DISP-SHR` in the OCL program supports a multi-user environment, ensuring no file locks during processing.
