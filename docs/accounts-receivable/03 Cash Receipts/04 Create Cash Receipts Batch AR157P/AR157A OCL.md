The provided document, `AR157A.ocl36.txt`, is an Operations Control Language (OCL) program used in IBM midrange systems (e.g., AS/400, iSeries) to perform field adjustments on an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) cash receipts batch file before its creation. This program is called by the `AR157.ocl36` OCL program, which itself is invoked as part of the EFT cash receipts batch file creation process orchestrated by the main `AR157P.ocl36` program. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and external programs called, based on the OCL code.

### Process Steps of the OCL Program (`AR157A`)

The `AR157A` OCL program is concise and focuses on loading and running a program to adjust fields in a specific file. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Load the AR157A Program**:
   - The statement `// LOAD AR157A` loads the `AR157A` program into memory for execution.
   - This indicates that `AR157A` is likely an RPG or CL program designed to perform specific field adjustments on the EFT cash receipts data.

2. **Open the CRTRAN File**:
   - The statement `// FILE NAME-CRTRAN,LABEL-?9?E?L'110,6'?,DISP-SHR` defines a file:
     - **Name**: `CRTRAN` (logical file name within the program).
     - **Label**: `?9?E?L'110,6'?` – A dynamically constructed physical file name, where:
       - `?9?` is a placeholder for a company code or batch identifier (consistent with other programs in the suite, e.g., `CO123`).
       - `?L'110,6'?` refers to a 6-character value stored at location 110 in the program’s local storage, likely the bank upload date (`KYUPDT` from the `AR157P` RPGLE program, e.g., `202311` for November 2023).
       - Example: The file might resolve to `QS36F/CO123E202311` (assuming `QS36F` is the library, as seen in `AR157.ocl36`).
     - **Disposition**: `DISP-SHR` (shared access), allowing multiple processes to access the file concurrently.
   - This file is opened for processing by the `AR157A` program.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - The statement `// RUN` executes the loaded `AR157A` program.
   - The program processes the `CRTRAN` file, performing field adjustments necessary for the EFT cash receipts batch file creation. The exact adjustments (e.g., formatting, calculations, or data transformations) are not specified in the OCL code and would be defined in the `AR157A` program’s logic (likely an RPG or CL program).

### Business Rules

The `AR157A` OCL program enforces the following business rules:

1. **Dynamic File Access**:
   - The program operates on a dynamically named file (`?9?E?L'110,6'?`), where the name is constructed using:
     - A company or batch identifier (`?9?`), ensuring the program processes data specific to the correct organizational context.
     - A bank upload date (`?L'110,6'?`), aligning the adjustments with the selected date for the cash receipts batch.
   - This ensures flexibility to handle multiple companies or batch dates.

2. **Shared File Access**:
   - The file is opened in shared mode (`DISP-SHR`), allowing other processes to access it concurrently, which is critical in a multi-user or multi-process environment to avoid file locks.

3. **Field Adjustment Preprocessing**:
   - The program is designed to adjust fields in the `CRTRAN` file before the data is copied to the final cash receipts batch file (`?9?CRIEGG` in `AR157.ocl36`).
   - Adjustments might include formatting EFT transaction data, updating specific fields (e.g., dates, amounts, or status flags), or ensuring compliance with EFT standards (e.g., ACH file formats).

4. **Dependency on Prior Validation**:
   - Since `AR157A` is called by `AR157.ocl36`, which is invoked after validations in `AR157P.rpgle`, the program assumes that the company number (`KYCO`) and bank upload date (`KYUPDT`) have been validated, and the `CRTRAN` file exists with relevant data.

### Tables/Files Used

The program interacts with the following file:

1. **CRTRAN**:
   - Logical Name: `CRTRAN`
   - Physical File Label: `?9?E?L'110,6'?` (e.g., `QS36F/CO123E202311`, where `?9?` is the company code and `?L'110,6'?` is the bank upload date).
   - Library: Likely `QS36F` (based on consistency with `AR157.ocl36`).
   - Disposition: `DISP-SHR` (shared access).
   - Purpose: Temporary workfile containing EFT individual entry data that requires field adjustments before being copied to the cash receipts batch file.
   - Usage: Opened and processed by the `AR157A` program for field modifications.

---

### External Programs Called

The program directly loads and runs:

1. **AR157A**:
   - Purpose: Performs field adjustments on the `CRTRAN` file to prepare EFT transaction data for inclusion in the cash receipts batch file.
   - Note: The OCL program loads `AR157A`, but the actual logic (e.g., RPG or CL code) is not provided, so the specific adjustments are unknown. It likely modifies fields such as transaction amounts, dates, or EFT-specific data to ensure compatibility with the target batch file.

No additional external programs are explicitly called in the OCL code.

### Notes
- **Integration with Program Suite**: The `AR157A` OCL program is a component of the EFT cash receipts batch creation process, called by `AR157.ocl36`, which is invoked by `AR157P.ocl36`. The `?9?` parameter (company/batch identifier) and `?L'110,6'?` (bank upload date) ensure consistency across the suite.
- **Jan Beccari Change**: The change from `?WS?` to `GG` (noted in `AR157.ocl36` and `AR157P.ocl36`) does not directly affect `AR157A`, but the target file in the subsequent `AR157` program (`?9?CRIEGG`) reflects this change, indicating `AR157A` prepares data for that file.
- **Purpose of Field Adjustments**: The adjustments in `AR157A` are likely critical to ensure the EFT data meets specific formatting or business requirements (e.g., aligning with banking standards or internal AR processes) before copying to the final batch file.
- **Shared Access**: The use of `DISP-SHR` supports a multi-user environment, ensuring the file can be accessed without conflicts during processing.
