Below is a table that lists the provided programs (`AR050P.ocl36`, `AR050P.rpgle`, `AR050.ocl36`, `AR050.rpgle`, `AR100.ocl36`, `AR100.rpgle`, `AR105.ocl36`, `AR105.rpg36`, `AR110.ocl36`, `AR110.rpg36`) as rows and the tables (files) used across these programs as columns. At each intersection, a brief description indicates how the program modifies, creates, or writes to the table, or if it only reads it. The table focuses on the unique files identified across the programs, reflecting their usage in the IBM System/36 accounts receivable (AR) cash receipts workflow with Atrium compatibility (`GG` suffixes).

### Notes
- **File Usage**:
  - **Reads**: Files accessed for validation or data retrieval (e.g., `ARCUST`, `ARDETL`, `GLMAST`, `ARCONT`, `GSTABL`) are typically shared (`DISP-SHR`, `DISP-SHRMM`).
  - **Writes/Creates**: Transaction and work files (`CRPSGG`, `CRIEGG`, `CR10GG`, `AR11GG`, `CRWKGG`, `CRCKGG`, `CRICGG`) are created or updated with new records.
  - **Deletes/Rebuilds**: Temporary files are deleted and rebuilt to ensure clean data (e.g., `CRPSGG`, `CRIEGG`, `CR10GG`).
  - **Sorts**: `AR105.ocl36` and `AR110.ocl36` use `#GSORT` to sort transactions into `CR10GG` (payments) or `AR11GG` (adjustments, disabled).
- **Outputs**:
  - **Reports**: `PRINT` (edit reports) and `NODLIST` (Notices of Difference) are generated by `AR100.rpgle`, `AR105.ocl36`, and `AR110.rpg36`.
  - **Side Effects**: Error flags (`'E'`) are set in transaction files; screen displays occur in interactive programs (`AR050.rpgle`, `AR100.rpgle`).
- **Atrium Compatibility**: All programs use `GG` suffixes (e.g., `CRPSGG`, `CRIEGG`) per JB01 (11/28/23).
- **Missing AR111**: Not provided but implied in `AR105.ocl36` for adjustment validation (disabled).
- **AR1101**: Implied in `AR110.ocl36` for post-validation tasks (e.g., posting), uses `GSPROD` and `NODPRINT`.

This table concisely captures how each program interacts with the relevant files, focusing on creation, modification, or read-only access within the cash receipts workflow.
