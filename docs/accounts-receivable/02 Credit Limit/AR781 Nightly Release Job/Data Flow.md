**Notes:**
- "-" indicates the program does not access or modify that file.
- All other files mentioned in the programs (e.g., printer files) are consolidated under JBLIST/REPORT for clarity.
- Access types: "Reads" includes sequential reads, chains (random access), and SETLL positioning; "Writes/Adds" typically via EXCPT/EADD; "Updates" via chained update.
