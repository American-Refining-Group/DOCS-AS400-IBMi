| Order | Program | Main Purpose | Tables/Files Used (Input/Intermediate) | Outputs/Files Written (or Updated) | Side Effects |
|-------|---------|--------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1     | AR781P | Pre-screens the open order backlog to identify parent/group customers that have at least one open order line flagged as over credit limit and not yet manually authorized, building a compact list for further processing. | BBORCL (open order lines), ARCUST (customer master), AR780I (intermediate work file, initially cleared) | AR780I (adds one record per qualifying group customer) | None (only populates intermediate file) |
| 2     | AR781  | Performs detailed group-level credit analysis on the pre-selected customers, calculates available credit, identifies specific order lines eligible for release, generates a printable report, and populates detail/header files for potential auto-release. | AR780I (list of group customers), ARCONT (company control), ARCUST (customer master), ARCUSP (customer contacts), BBORCL (open order lines), ARCLGR (credit group members), BBORDR (order headers) | CREDREL (detail records for eligible orders), CREDRLH (group summary headers), JBLIST/REPORT (printer file) | Produces the "CREDIT HOLD ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE REPORT" spooled output |
| 3     | AR781A | Automatically releases eligible orders identified by AR781 by marking them as authorized in the backlog, reducing available credit in the summary file, and printing a simple audit log. | CREDREL (eligible order details), CREDRLH (group summaries), BBORCL (open order lines) | BBORCL (updates authorization fields on released orders), CREDRLH (updates available credit), REPORT (printer file) | Actually releases credit holds on qualifying orders (side effect: orders become releasable for picking/shipping); prints audit report of auto-released orders |
