Process Steps of the OCL Program
OCL is a scripting language used to define job control steps, such as loading programs, specifying files, and controlling execution flow. Here’s a breakdown of the steps in the provided OCL program:
1.	Comment Section: 
o	The lines starting with ** are comments, providing metadata about the program: 
	CREDIT LIMIT GROUPING MAINTENANCE indicates the program’s purpose, likely related to maintaining credit limit groupings in an accounts receivable (AR) system.
2.	Call External Program (GSGENIEC): 
o	// CALL PGM(GSGENIEC): 
	This step invokes an external program named GSGENIEC. This program is likely a utility or initialization program that performs setup or validation tasks before the main program execution.
	The specific functionality of GSGENIEC is not detailed in the snippet, but it’s a prerequisite step.
3.	Conditional Check (IFF Statement): 
o	// IFF ?L'506,3'?/YES RETURN: 
	This is a conditional statement checking a system variable or parameter at location L'506,3'. The ?L'506,3'? syntax refers to a specific memory location or indicator in the system’s Local Data Area (LDA) or a similar mechanism.
	If the condition evaluates to YES (true), the program executes a RETURN, which terminates the OCL procedure without proceeding further.
	This acts as a gatekeeper, allowing the program to proceed only if the condition is false.
4.	Procedure Call (SCPROCP): 
o	// SCPROCP ,,,,,,,,?9?: 
	This invokes a procedure named SCPROCP with placeholder parameters (indicated by commas and ?9?).
	The ?9? likely represents a parameter or library reference (e.g., a library name or a specific value passed to the procedure).
	The exact purpose of SCPROCP is unclear from the snippet, but it could be a system procedure for setting up the environment or processing data.
5.	GSY2K Execution: 
o	// GSY2K: 
	This step calls a program or proceduremechanism named GSY2K, likely related to Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance or date handling, which is common in legacy RPG systems.
	This program may perform date-related validations or transformations, ensuring compatibility with two-digit year formats.
6.	Load Program (AR489): 
o	// LOAD AR489: 
	This loads the main RPG program named AR489, which is the core program for the credit limit grouping maintenance functionality.
	AR489 is likely an RPG (Report Program Generator) program responsible for the business logic, such as updating or querying credit limit groupings.
7.	File Definitions: 
o	// FILE NAME-ARCLGR,LABEL-?9?ARCLGR,DISP-SHR: 
	Declares a file named ARCLGR (likely “Accounts Receivable Credit Limit Grouping”) with a label prefixed by ?9? (indicating a library or system-specific prefix).
	DISP-SHR specifies that the file is opened in shared mode, allowing multiple processes to access it concurrently.
o	// FILE NAME-ARCONT,LABEL-?9?ARCONT,DISP-SHR: 
	Declares another file named ARCONT (likely “Accounts Receivable Control”), also with a ?9? prefix and shared access.
	These files are likely database files containing data for credit limit groupings and control information.
8.	Run the Program: 
o	// RUN: 
	Executes the loaded AR489 program, which processes the data in the ARCLGR and ARCONT files to perform the credit limit grouping maintenance tasks.
External Programs Called
The OCL program explicitly calls the following external programs:
1.	GSGENIEC: 
o	Likely a utility or initialization program for setup or validation.
2.	GSY2K: 
o	A program handling Year 2000 date-related logic.
3.	AR489: 
o	The main RPG program for credit limit grouping maintenance.
4.	SCPROCP: 
o	A procedure, possibly for system setup or parameter processing, though its exact role is unclear.
Tables (Files) Used
The OCL program references the following files (equivalent to tables in modern database terminology):
1.	ARCLGR: 
o	Likely stores data related to credit limit groupings, such as customer credit limits or group assignments.
2.	ARCONT: 
o	Likely a control file containing configuration or control data for the accounts receivable system.
Summary
The OCL program orchestrates the execution of the AR489 RPG program for maintaining credit limit groupings. It performs the following steps:
•	Calls GSGENIEC for initialization.
•	Checks a condition to decide whether to proceed or terminate.
•	Invokes SCPROCP for additional setup or processing.
•	Runs GSY2K for date-related processing.
•	Loads and executes AR489, using the ARCLGR and ARCONT files for data access.
The program relies on two database files (ARCLGR and ARCONT) and calls four external programs/procedures (GSGENIEC, SCPROCP, GSY2K, and AR489) to complete its tasks. The ?9? placeholders suggest dynamic library or parameter references, typical in System/36 environments.
