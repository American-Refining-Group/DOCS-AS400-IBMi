The provided document, `AR415.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG III program (RPG/400) on the IBM i (AS/400) platform, called by the OCL program `AR415.ocl36.txt`. This program generates a **Customers Over Credit Report**, processing customer data to identify and report customers whose total due amounts exceed their credit limits. It uses multiple files to gather customer, order, and ledger data, producing two printed reports: one for all customers and another for orders exceeding credit limits. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AR415 RPG Program

The `AR415` program processes customer data by company, calculates credit-related metrics, and generates two printed reports (`ARLIST` and `ARLIS2`). Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - The program defines files:
     - `ARCUST` (input primary, 384 bytes, sorted input from `#GSORT`).
     - `ARCUSA` (input chained, 384 bytes, keyed at position 2).
     - `BBORCL` (input file, 256 bytes, keyed at position 2).
     - `BICONT` (input file, 256 bytes, keyed at position 2).
     - `ARCLGR` (input chained, 240 bytes, keyed at position 2).
     - `ARLIST` (output, 164 bytes, primary printer file).
     - `ARLIS2` (output, 164 bytes, secondary printer file for over-limit orders).
   - Defines arrays and data structures:
     - `SEP` (2-element array for separator lines).
     - `ARC` (25-element array, 6 bytes each, for customer numbers from `ARCLGR`).
     - Data structure `UDS` with `CO` (company code, 2 digits) and `KYCANC` (cancel key, 6 characters).
   - Input specifications define fields for each file (e.g., `ARKEY`, `ARCO`, `ARCUST`, `ARNAME`, `ARTOTD`, `ARCLMT`, etc.).
   - Initializes variables like `TIMDAT`, `SYTIME`, and `SYDATE` for report headers.

2. **Company-Level Processing (`L2` Loop)**:
   - For each company (`L2` control break on `ARCO`):
     - Chains to `BICONT` using `CO` to retrieve company name (`BCNAME`).
     - Sets separator line (`SEP = '* '`) and captures system time (`SYTIME`) and date (`SYDATE`) using the `TIME` operation.
     - Prints company-level headings on both `ARLIST` (via `PRTL2`) and `ARLIS2` (via `PRTL22`) output files.

3. **Customer-Level Processing (`L1` Loop)**:
   - For each customer (`L1` control break on `ARCUST`):
     - Initializes variables: `OVER`, `LIMIT`, `OWED`, `ORDVAL`, `TRXVAL` to zero, and clears indicator `93`.
     - Chains to `ARCLGR` using `ARKEY` (positions 2–9) to retrieve customer numbers in the `ARC` array.
     - If `ARCLGR` is found (`*IN95 = *OFF`) and not deleted (`CGDEL <> 'D'`):
       - Loops through the `ARC` array (up to 25 customer numbers):
         - Constructs `CUSKEY` (company + customer number).
         - Chains to `ARCUSA` using `CUSKEY` to get customer data (`AXCLMT`, `AXTOTD`).
         - If found (`*IN93 = *OFF`) and `AXCLMT <> 0`, adds `AXCLMT` to `LIMIT`.
         - Adds `AXTOTD` to `OWED`.
         - Processes `BBORCL` records for the customer (using `BCLKEY` = `HLD8`):
           - Sets lower limit (`SETLL`) and reads `BBORCL` until EOF (`*IN66`) or customer mismatch (`*IN79`).
           - Skips deleted records (`BLDEL = 'D'`).
           - Adds `BLTAMT` (unposted amount) to `TRXVAL` and `OWED` if non-zero.
           - Adds `BLOAMT` (order amount) to `ORDVAL` and `OWED` if non-zero.

4. **Primary Customer Processing**:
   - After the `ARCLGR` loop, processes the primary `ARCUST` record:
     - If `LIMIT = 0`, sets `LIMIT = ARCLMT` (from `ARCUST`).
     - Adds `ARTOTD` to `OWED`.
     - Processes `BBORCL` records again for the customer (using `BCLKEY = ARKEY`):
       - Similar logic to above: skips deleted records, adds `BLTAMT` to `TRXVAL` and `OWED`, adds `BLOAMT` to `ORDVAL` and `OWED`.
       - If `BLOVCL = 'Y'` (over credit limit), prints an over-limit line (`OVRLNE`) to `ARLIS2` with order details (`BLORDR`, `BLTAMT`, `BLBTCH`).

5. **Credit Limit Check and Output**:
   - Calculates `OVER = LIMIT - OWED`.
   - If `OVER < 0`, sets indicator `44` to indicate the customer is over their credit limit.
   - Prints customer details to `ARLIST` (via `PRTL2`):
     - Includes `ARCUST`, `ARNAME`, `ARCLMT`, `ARTOTD`, `ORDVAL`, `TRXVAL`, and `OVER` (with “OVER CREDIT LIMIT” if `*IN44 = *ON`).

6. **Report Output**:
   - `ARLIST` report:
     - Prints company name (`BCNAME`), date (`SYDATE`), time (`SYTIME`), and page number.
     - Includes headers for “CREDIT LIMIT”, “TOTAL DUE”, “OPEN ORDERS TOTAL”, “UNPOSTED AMOUNT”, and “AVAIL CREDIT”.
     - Lists customer data with over-limit indication.
   - `ARLIS2` report:
     - Prints similar headers but focuses on “ORDERS OVER CREDIT LIMIT”.
     - Lists orders exceeding credit limits with `BLORDR`, `BLTAMT`, and `BLBTCH`.

7. **Program Termination**:
   - The program ends after processing all `ARCUST` records, triggered by the end of the input file.

### Business Rules

1. **Company Validation**:
   - The program processes data for a specific company (`CO`), retrieving the company name from `BICONT`.
   - If the company is not found in `BICONT`, processing continues with default values.

2. **Customer Credit Calculation**:
   - Aggregates credit limit (`LIMIT`) from `ARCUSA` (`AXCLMT`) or `ARCUST` (`ARCLMT`).
   - Calculates total owed (`OWED`) by summing:
     - `ARTOTD` (total due from `ARCUST`).
     - `AXTOTD` (total due from `ARCUSA` for customers in `ARCLGR`).
     - `BLTAMT` (unposted amounts from `BBORCL`).
     - `BLOAMT` (order amounts from `BBORCL`).
   - Tracks `TRXVAL` (unposted amounts) and `ORDVAL` (order amounts) separately.

3. **Over Credit Limit Detection**:
   - A customer is over their credit limit if `OVER = LIMIT - OWED < 0`.
   - Orders marked as over credit limit (`BLOVCL = 'Y'`) in `BBORCL` are printed in the `ARLIS2` report.

4. **Data Filtering**:
   - Skips deleted customers (`CGDEL = 'D'` in `ARCLGR`) and deleted orders (`BLDEL = 'D'` in `BBORCL`).
   - Only processes non-zero amounts (`BLTAMT`, `BLOAMT`, `AXCLMT`, `AXTOTD`).

5. **Report Formatting**:
   - Produces two reports:
     - `ARLIST`: Lists all customers with credit limit, total due, open orders, unposted amounts, and available credit.
     - `ARLIS2`: Lists specific orders exceeding credit limits with order number, unposted amount, and batch number.
   - Includes company name, date, time, and page numbers in headers.

### External Programs Called

The `AR415` program does not call any external programs. It performs all processing internally, relying on file I/O and printer output operations.

### Summary

**Process Steps**:
- Initializes files, arrays, and variables.
- Processes each company (`L2`), retrieving company name and printing headers.
- For each customer (`L1`):
  - Aggregates credit limits and amounts owed from `ARCUST`, `ARCUSA`, and `BBORCL`.
  - Processes `ARCLGR` to include additional customer data.
  - Calculates over-credit status and prints to `ARLIST` (all customers) and `ARLIS2` (over-limit orders).
- Terminates after processing all records.

**Business Rules**:
- Validates company and skips deleted customers/orders.
- Aggregates total owed from multiple sources (`ARTOTD`, `AXTOTD`, `BLTAMT`, `BLOAMT`).
- Identifies customers over credit limits (`OVER < 0`) and orders marked as over limit (`BLOVCL = 'Y'`).
- Produces formatted reports with headers and detailed data.

**Files Used**: `ARCUST`, `ARCUSA`, `BBORCL`, `BICONT`, `ARCLGR`, `ARLIST`, `ARLIS2`.
**External Programs**: None.
