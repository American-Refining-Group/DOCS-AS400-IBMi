The RPG program `AR190.rpg36.txt` is an RPG/36 program (likely for an IBM System/36 or AS/400 environment) that handles the **A/R Salesman Change Transaction Add/Update** process, as referenced in the previously provided `.OCL` file (AR190.ocl36.txt). Below, I’ll explain the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables used**, and **external programs called** based on the provided RPG code. The program manages the addition and updating of salesman change transactions in an Accounts Receivable (A/R) system, allowing users to assign or reassign salesmen to customers and mark transactions for deletion.

### Process Steps of RPG Program AR190

The `AR190` program is an interactive application that uses a workstation (display) file to manage salesman change transactions. It operates with two primary screens (`S1` and `S2`) and performs validation, data retrieval, and file updates. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process steps, derived from the RPG code:

1. **Program Initialization and File Setup**:
   - The program defines four files:
     - `SCREEN`: A workstation file (display device) for user interaction, with a record length of 1000 bytes.
     - `ARSLST`: A disk file (update mode, `UF`) for salesman change transactions, with a record length of 256 bytes and an 8-byte key starting at position 2.
     - `ARCONT`: A disk file (input mode, `IF`) for A/R control data, with a 256-byte record length and a 2-byte key.
     - `ARCUST`: A disk file (input mode, `IF`) for customer master data, with a 384-byte record length and an 8-byte key.
     - `GSTABL`: A disk file (input mode, `IF`) for general table data (e.g., salesman codes), with a 256-byte record length and a 12-byte key.
   - The program initializes variables and clears the screen fields for the first display (`$SBLK` subroutine, lines 0084–0105).
     - Clears arrays (`CUS`, `CUNM`, `SLO`, `SLN`, `SLNM`, `DL`) and sets the initial screen format to `S1` (`@SFNEX = 'S1'`).
     - Turns off error indicators and sets display indicators (e.g., 99, 81) to control screen behavior.

2. **Main Processing Loop (`$SFNEX DOWNE 'EJ'`, lines 0068–0079)**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until the user presses a command key to exit (`@SFNEX = 'EJ'`).
   - Based on the screen format identifier (`@SFID`):
     - If `@SFID` is blank, it calls `$SBLK` to initialize the screen (first-time display).
     - If `@SFID = 'S1'`, it processes the first screen (`$S1` subroutine).
     - If `@SFID = 'S2'`, it processes the second screen (`$S2` subroutine).
   - After processing the screen, it calls `$XCPT` to display the next screen and reads user input from the `SCREEN` file (`READ SCREEN`, with or without the Last Record indicator based on `@CCNT`).

3. **Screen 1 Processing (`$S1`, lines 0108–0115)**:
   - **Purpose**: Collects the company number (`CO`) and an optional customer number (`SCUS`) to filter transactions.
   - **Steps**:
     - Reads the `S1` screen input (`AR190S1` format, lines 0678–0682).
     - Checks the function key pressed (`@VKEY`):
       - If `ENTER` (`@VKEY = 0`), calls `$S1ENT` to validate and process the input.
       - If a command key is pressed (`@VKEY = 2`), calls `$S1CK` to handle command key functions (e.g., exit).
     - **Validation (`$S1ENT`, lines 0118–0146)**:
       - Ensures the company number (`CO`) is not zero; if it is, displays error message MSG1 ("COMPANY NUMBER CANNOT BE BLANK") and sets indicator 90 (error) and 81 (highlight field).
       - Validates `CO` against the `ARCONT` file using `CHAIN`. If not found, displays MSG2 ("COMPANY NOT IN CONTROL FILE") and sets error indicators.
       - If valid, sets up keys (`FRKEY`, `TOPKEY`, `BOTKEY`) for accessing `ARSLST` and moves to screen `S2` by setting `@SFNEX = 'S2'`.
       - Calls `$S2RFW` to populate screen `S2` with transaction data.
     - **Command Keys (`$S1CK`, lines 0149–0154)**:
       - If command key `KG` is pressed, sets `@SFNEX = 'EJ'` to exit the program.

4. **Screen 2 Processing (`$S2`, lines 0157–0166)**:
   - **Purpose**: Displays and allows editing of up to 10 salesman change transactions, including customer number (`CUS`), old salesman code (`SLO`), new salesman code (`SLN`), salesman name (`SLNM`), and delete code (`DL`).
   - **Steps**:
     - Reads the `S2` screen input (`AR190S2` format, lines 0683–0694).
     - Checks the function key pressed (`@VKEY`):
       - If `ENTER` (`@VKEY = 0`), calls `$S2ENT` to validate and update transactions.
       - If a command key is pressed (`@VKEY = 2`), calls `$S2CK` to handle command keys (e.g., exit or return to `S1`).
       - If `ROLL UP` (`@VKEY = 01122`), calls `$S2RFW` to display the next set of records.
       - If `ROLL DOWN` (`@VKEY = 01123`), calls `$S2RBW` to display the previous set of records.

5. **Screen 2 Validation and Update (`$S2ENT`, lines 0169–0334)**:
   - **Validation Loop (lines 0173–0288)**:
     - Iterates through the 10 transaction lines (`X = 1 to 10`).
     - For each line where `DL,X ≠ 'D'` (not marked for deletion):
       - **Customer Validation**:
         - If a salesman is keyed (`SLN,X ≠ 0`) but no customer is provided (`CUS,X = 0`), sets error indicators (70–79) and displays MSG3 ("CUSTOMER CANNOT BE ZERO") and MSG4 ("WHEN NEW SALESMAN IS KEYED").
         - If a customer is keyed (`CUS,X ≠ 0`), validates it against `ARCUST` using `CHAIN`. If not found, sets error indicators (70–79) and displays MSG5 ("INVALID CUSTOMER NUMBER").
         - If valid, retrieves the customer name (`ARNAME` to `CUNM,X`) and old salesman code (`ARSLMN` to `SLO,X`).
       - **New Salesman Validation**:
         - If a customer is keyed, validates the new salesman code (`SLN,X`) against `GSTABL` using `CHAIN` with key `SLSMAN + SLN,X`. If not found, sets error indicators (60–69) and displays MSG6 ("INVALID NEW SALESMAN CODE").
         - If valid, retrieves the salesman name (`TBDESC` to `SLNM,X`).
         - Note: A validation check for `SLN,X ≠ SLO,X` (new salesman different from old) was removed on 09/27/17, per the comment on line 0247.
       - **Delete Code Validation**:
         - If a customer is keyed, checks if the delete code (`DL,X`) is `' '`, `'A'`, or `'D'`. If invalid, sets error indicators (40–49) and displays MSG7 ("DELETE CODE MUST BE ' ',A, OR D").
     - If any validation errors occur, jumps to `ENDS2E` to redisplay the screen with error messages.
   - **Update Transactions (lines 0294–0315)**:
     - Iterates through the 10 transaction lines again.
     - For each line with a customer number (`CUS,X ≠ 0`):
       - Builds a key (`FRKEY = CO + CUS,X`) and checks `ARSLST` using `CHAIN`.
       - If `DL,X ≠ 'D'`:
         - If the record exists (`95 off`), updates it (`EXCPTUPDREC`).
         - If the record doesn’t exist (`95 on`), adds it (`EXCPTADDREC`).
       - If `DL,X = 'D'` and the record doesn’t exist (`95 off`), deletes it (`EXCPTDELREC`).
       - Updates `BOTKEY` and `SVKEY` to track the highest key processed.
     - If the last line has a customer (`CUS,10 > 0`), sets `S2FULL = 'Y'` to indicate a full screen.
     - If no records are entered (`CUS,10 = 0` and `SLN,10 = 0`), returns to screen `S1` (`@SFNEX = 'S1'`) and clears fields (`CLRFLD`).
     - Otherwise, calls `$S2RFW` to refresh the screen with the next set of records and sets `@SFNEX = 'S2'`.

6. **Roll Up (Forward) (`$S2RFW`, lines 0351–0484)**:
   - Populates screen `S2` with the next set of records from `ARSLST` starting at `BOTKEY`.
   - Clears arrays (`CUS`, `CUNM`, `SLO`, `SLN`, `SLNM`, `DL`) and resets indicators.
   - Reads `ARSLST` sequentially, filtering by company number (`ASCO = CO`).
   - For each valid record (up to 10):
     - Copies data to screen arrays (`ASCUST` to `CUS,Y`, `ASSLSO` to `SLO,Y`, `ASSLSN` to `SLN,Y`, `ASDEL` to `DL,Y`).
     - Retrieves customer name from `ARCUST` and salesman name from `GSTABL`.
     - If the record is marked deleted (`ASDEL = 'D'`), displays MSG8 ("THIS RECORD PREVIOUSLY DELETED").
     - Sets indicators (50–59, 60–69) to protect fields for existing records.
   - Updates `TOPKEY` and `BOTKEY` to track the range of displayed records.
   - If the end of the file is reached, displays MSG9 ("END OF FILE HAS BEEN REACHED") and calls `RESET` to redisplay the last screen.
   - If fewer than 10 records are read and `S2FULL ≠ 'Y'`, clears remaining fields.

7. **Roll Down (Backward) (`$S2RBW`, lines 0539–0615)**:
   - Populates screen `S2` with the previous set of records from `ARSLST` starting at `TOPKEY`.
   - Reads `ARSLST` in reverse (`READP`) until 10 records are loaded or the beginning of the file is reached.
   - Similar to `$S2RFW`, copies data to screen arrays, retrieves names, and sets indicators.
   - If the beginning of the file is reached, displays MSG10 ("BEGINNING OF FILE HAS BEEN REACHED").
   - Updates `TOPKEY` and `BOTKEY` accordingly.

8. **Screen 2 Command Keys (`$S2CK`, lines 0337–0348)**:
   - If command key `KA` is pressed, clears fields (`CLRFLD`) and returns to screen `S1` (`@SFNEX = 'S1'`).
   - If command key `KG` is pressed, exits the program (`@SFNEX = 'EJ'`).

9. **Display Next Screen (`$XCPT`, lines 0618–0637)**:
   - Increments a counter (`@CCNT`) to track screen displays.
   - Displays the appropriate screen based on `@SFNEX`:
     - If `@SFNEX = 'S1'`, outputs the `AR190S1` format.
     - If `@SFNEX = 'S2'`, outputs the `AR190S2` format.
   - Calls `CLRIND` to reset error indicators and clear message fields (`MSG1`, `MSG2`).

10. **Field and Indicator Clearing**:
    - **CLRIND (lines 0640–0662)**: Resets error indicators (40–49, 60–69, 70–79, 90, 91, etc.) and clears message fields.
    - **CLRFLD (lines 0665–0675)**: Clears screen arrays (`CUS`, `CUNM`, `SLO`, `SLN`, `SLNM`, `DL`) and `S2FULL`.

11. **Output Operations**:
    - **ADDREC (lines 0696–0701)**: Adds a new record to `ARSLST` with company number (`CO`), customer number (`CUS,X`), old salesman (`SLO,X`), and new salesman (`SLN,X`).
    - **UPDREC (lines 0703–0706)**: Updates an existing `ARSLST` record with delete code (`DL,X`), old salesman (`SLO,X`), and new salesman (`SLN,X`).
    - **DELREC (line 0708)**: Deletes a record from `ARSLST`.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules for managing salesman change transactions:

1. **Company Number Validation**:
   - The company number (`CO`) must not be blank/zero (MSG1: "COMPANY NUMBER CANNOT BE BLANK").
   - The company number must exist in the `ARCONT` file (MSG2: "COMPANY NOT IN CONTROL FILE").

2. **Customer Number Validation**:
   - If a new salesman code (`SLN,X`) is entered, a customer number (`CUS,X`) must be provided (MSG3: "CUSTOMER CANNOT BE ZERO" and MSG4: "WHEN NEW SALESMAN IS KEYED").
   - The customer number must exist in the `ARCUST` file (MSG5: "INVALID CUSTOMER NUMBER").

3. **Salesman Code Validation**:
   - The new salesman code (`SLN,X`) must exist in the `GSTABL` file under the `SLSMAN` table (MSG6: "INVALID NEW SALESMAN CODE").
   - A previous rule requiring the new salesman to differ from the old salesman (`SLN,X ≠ SLO,X`) was removed on 09/27/17 (lines 0247–0264).

4. **Delete Code Validation**:
   - The delete code (`DL,X`) must be `' '` (blank), `'A'`, or `'D'` (MSG7: "DELETE CODE MUST BE ' ',A, OR D").
   - If `DL,X = 'D'`, the record is marked for deletion, and if it doesn’t exist in `ARSLST`, it is deleted via `EXCPTDELREC`.

5. **Transaction Processing**:
   - If a customer number is entered:
     - If the record exists in `ARSLST` and `DL,X ≠ 'D'`, it is updated (`UPDREC`).
     - If the record does not exist and `DL,X ≠ 'D'`, it is added (`ADDREC`).
     - If the record does not exist and `DL,X = 'D'`, it is deleted (`DELREC`).
   - Deleted records in `ARSLST` (`ASDEL = 'D'`) are flagged with MSG8 ("THIS RECORD PREVIOUSLY DELETED").

6. **Screen Navigation**:
   - Screen `S1` collects the company number and optional customer number.
   - Screen `S2` displays up to 10 transactions and supports roll-up/roll-down for navigation.
   - If no records are entered or the end of the file is reached, the program returns to screen `S1`.
   - The end of the file (`ARSLST`) triggers MSG9 ("END OF FILE HAS BEEN REACHED").
   - The beginning of the file triggers MSG10 ("BEGINNING OF FILE HAS BEEN REACHED").

7. **Field Protection**:
   - Customer numbers for existing records are protected (indicators 50–59) to prevent modification.
   - Error indicators (40–49, 60–69, 70–79) highlight invalid fields on screen `S2`.

8. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Customer names are retrieved from `ARCUST` (`ARNAME`).
   - Salesman names are retrieved from `GSTABL` (`TBDESC`) for the `SLSMAN` table.
   - The old salesman code is retrieved from `ARCUST` (`ARSLMN`) or `ARSLST` (`ASSLSO`).

### Tables (Files) Used

The following files are used by the `AR190` program:
1. **SCREEN**: Workstation file for user interaction (display/input).
2. **ARSLST**: Salesman change transaction file (update mode, `UF`), stores transaction records with fields:
   - `ASDEL` (1 byte, delete code: `' '`, `'A'`, or `'D'`).
   - `ASCO` (company number, positions 2–3).
   - `ASCUST` (customer number, positions 4–9).
   - `ASSLSO` (old salesman code, positions 10–11).
   - `ASSLSN` (new salesman code, positions 12–13).
3. **ARCONT**: A/R control file (input mode, `IF`), contains company data with fields:
   - `ACNAME` (company name, positions 4–33).
4. **ARCUST**: Customer master file (input mode, `IF`), contains customer data with fields:
   - `ARNAME` (customer name, positions 10–39).
   - `ARSLMN` (salesman code, positions 263–264).
5. **GSTABL**: General table file (input mode, `IF`), contains reference data (e.g., salesman codes) with fields:
   - `TBDESC` (table description, e.g., salesman name, positions 14–43).

### External Programs Called

The `AR190` program does not explicitly call any external programs (e.g., via `CALL` operations). It operates as a standalone program, handling all logic internally through subroutines.
