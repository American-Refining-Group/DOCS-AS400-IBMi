The RPG program `AR191.rpg36.txt` is an RPG/36 program (likely for an IBM System/36 or AS/400 environment) that handles the **A/R Salesman Change Transaction Edit** process, as referenced in the previously provided `.OCL` file (AR190.ocl36.txt). This program generates a printed report listing salesman change transactions from the `ARSLST` file, including customer and salesman details, with validation against related files. Below, I’ll explain the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables used**, and **external programs called** based on the provided RPG code.

### Process Steps of RPG Program AR191

The `AR191` program is a batch reporting program that processes records from the `ARSLST` file and produces a formatted report on a printer file (`ARPRINT`). It retrieves additional data from the `ARCUST` and `GSTABL` files to enrich the report with customer names and salesman descriptions. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **File Definitions and Initialization**:
   - **Files Defined**:
     - `ARSLST`: Primary input file (`IP`) for salesman change transactions, with a 256-byte record length and an 8-byte key starting at position 2. Fields include:
       - `ASDEL` (delete code, position 1, `'D'` for deleted records).
       - `ASCO` (company number, positions 2–3).
       - `ASCUST` (customer number, positions 4–9).
       - `ASSLSO` (old salesman code, positions 10–11).
       - `ASSLSN` (new salesman code, positions 12–13).
     - `ARCUST`: Input file (`IF`) for customer master data, with a 384-byte record length and an 8-byte key. Fields include:
       - `ARNAME` (customer name, positions 10–39).
     - `GSTABL`: Input file (`IF`) for general table data (e.g., salesman codes), with a 256-byte record length and a 12-byte key. Fields include:
       - `TBDESC` (table description, e.g., salesman name, positions 14–43).
     - `ARPRINT`: Output file (`O`) for the printed report, with a 132-byte record length.
   - **Initial Setup (lines 0022–0029)**:
     - The program checks the `ONCE` variable to ensure initialization occurs only once (`ONCE = 0`).
     - Sets `ONCE = 1` to prevent re-execution of initialization.
     - Captures the current time (`TIME`) into `TIMEX` (12 digits).
     - Formats the time into `TIMEOF` (6 characters, likely HHMMSS) and date into `DATE` (6 characters, likely MMDDYY).
     - This information is used in the report header.

2. **Record Processing Loop**:
   - The program implicitly processes each record in `ARSLST` sequentially, as `ARSLST` is defined as the primary input file (`IP`), triggering a level break (`L1`) on changes in the company number (`ASCO`).
   - For each `ARSLST` record (lines 0032–0043):
     - **Customer Lookup**:
       - Builds a key (`ARKEY`) by combining `ASCO` (company number) and `ASCUST` (customer number).
       - Performs a `CHAIN` operation on `ARCUST` to retrieve the customer name (`ARNAME`).
       - If the customer is not found (indicator 10 on), sets `ARNAME` to `'INVALID'`; otherwise, uses the retrieved `ARNAME`.
     - **Salesman Lookup**:
       - Builds a key (`SLKEY`) by combining the literal `'SLSMAN'` and the new salesman code (`ASSLSN`).
       - Performs a `CHAIN` operation on `GSTABL` to retrieve the salesman description (`TBDESC`).
       - If the salesman code is not found (indicator 10 on), sets `TBDESC` to `'INVALID'`; otherwise, uses the retrieved `TBDESC`.

3. **Report Generation**:
   - The program writes records to the `ARPRINT` printer file using output specifications (lines 0046–0089).
   - **Header Output (lines 0046–0082)**:
     - On a level break (`L1`, change in `ASCO`) or overflow (`OF`), prints the report header:
       - Page number (`PAGE`) at position 104–108 (e.g., "PAGE 001").
       - Date (`DATE`, formatted as MM/DD/YY) at position 120–129.
       - Report title ("* SALESMAN CHANGE EDIT *") centered at position 75.
       - Time (`TIMEOF`, formatted as HH.MM.SS) at position 120–129.
       - Decorative lines of asterisks (`* * * * * * * * * * * *`) across positions 24–131.
       - Column headers:
         - "CO" (company number) at position 2.
         - "CUSTOMER #", "NAME", "SALESMAN OLD NEW" at positions 11, 32, and 58, respectively.
       - Another set of decorative asterisk lines.
   - **Detail Output (lines 0083–0089)**:
     - For each `ARSLST` record (conditioned by `01`, non-deleted records where `ASDEL ≠ 'D'`):
       - `ASCO` (company number) at position 2.
       - `ASCUST` (customer number, zero-suppressed) at position 10.
       - `ARNAME` (customer name from `ARCUST`) at position 45.
       - `ASSLSO` (old salesman code) at position 53.
       - `ASSLSN` (new salesman code) at position 58.
       - `TBDESC` (new salesman description from `GSTABL`) at position 90.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - The program ends automatically after processing all `ARSLST` records, as is typical for primary input file processing in RPG/36. No explicit loop termination is coded, and the program closes the printer file (`ARPRINT`) upon completion.

### Business Rules

The `AR191` program enforces the following business rules for generating the salesman change edit report:

1. **Record Selection**:
   - Only non-deleted records (`ASDEL ≠ 'D'`) from `ARSLST` are included in the report (indicator `01` in output specifications, line 0083).
   - Records are grouped by company number (`ASCO`), with a level break (`L1`) triggering header output when the company number changes.

2. **Data Validation and Enrichment**:
   - **Customer Validation**:
     - Each `ARSLST` record’s customer number (`ASCUST`) is validated against the `ARCUST` file using the key `ASCO + ASCUST`.
     - If the customer is not found, the report displays `'INVALID'` for the customer name (`ARNAME`).
   - **Salesman Validation**:
     - The new salesman code (`ASSLSN`) is validated against the `GSTABL` file using the key `'SLSMAN' + ASSLSN`.
     - If the salesman code is not found, the report displays `'INVALID'` for the salesman description (`TBDESC`).

3. **Report Formatting**:
   - The report includes a header with page number, date, time, and title, printed on each company change (`L1`) or page overflow (`OF`).
   - Detail lines show:
     - Company number (`ASCO`).
     - Customer number (`ASCUST`, zero-suppressed).
     - Customer name (`ARNAME`).
     - Old salesman code (`ASSLSO`).
     - New salesman code (`ASSLSN`).
     - New salesman description (`TBDESC`).
   - The report is formatted with fixed-position fields and decorative asterisk lines for readability.

4. **Date and Time**:
   - The report includes the system date and time in the header, formatted as MM/DD/YY and HH.MM.SS, respectively.

---

### Tables (Files) Used

The following files are used by the `AR191` program:
1. **ARSLST**: Primary input file for salesman change transactions (input mode, `IP`), containing:
   - `ASDEL` (delete code, 1 byte, `'D'` for deleted records).
   - `ASCO` (company number, positions 2–3).
   - `ASCUST` (customer number, positions 4–9).
   - `ASSLSO` (old salesman code, positions 10–11).
   - `ASSLSN` (new salesman code, positions 12–13).
2. **ARCUST**: Customer master file (input mode, `IF`), containing:
   - `ARNAME` (customer name, positions 10–39).
3. **GSTABL**: General table file (input mode, `IF`), containing:
   - `TBDESC` (table description, e.g., salesman name, positions 14–43).
4. **ARPRINT**: Printer output file (`O`), used to generate the report with a 132-byte record length.

### External Programs Called

The `AR191` program does not explicitly call any external programs (e.g., via `CALL` operations). It operates as a standalone batch program, processing input files and generating output directly to the printer file.

### Summary

- **Process Steps**:
  - Initializes the program by capturing the system date and time for the report header.
  - Processes each `ARSLST` record sequentially, grouped by company number (`ASCO`).
  - Validates customer numbers against `ARCUST` and salesman codes against `GSTABL`, marking invalid entries with `'INVALID'`.
  - Generates a formatted report to `ARPRINT` with headers (on company change or page overflow) and detail lines for non-deleted records.
  - Terminates after processing all records.

- **Business Rules**:
  - Includes only non-deleted `ARSLST` records (`ASDEL ≠ 'D'`).
  - Validates customer and salesman data, displaying `'INVALID'` for missing records.
  - Groups records by company number, with headers printed on company changes or page overflows.
  - Formats the report with fixed-position fields, including date, time, and decorative lines.

- **Tables Used**: `ARSLST`, `ARCUST`, `GSTABL`, `ARPRINT`.

- **External Programs**: None.

This program complements `AR190` (add/update transactions) by providing a printed edit report to verify salesman change transactions.
