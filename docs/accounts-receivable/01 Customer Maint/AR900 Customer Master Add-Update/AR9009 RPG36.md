The provided document is an RPG/36 program named `AR9009.rpg36.txt`, called from the main OCL script `AR900.ocl36.txt` to verify whether a customer has activity (e.g., invoices or sales) before allowing deletion in the **Customer Master File Maintenance** process (`AR900`) on an IBM midrange system (likely System/36 or AS/400, now IBM i). Below, I explain the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables used**, and **external programs called** by this RPG program.

### **Process Steps of the RPG Program**

The `AR9009` program checks for customer activity in specific files to determine if a customer can be deleted. It is invoked from `AR900` to ensure that customers with active records (e.g., open invoices or sales) are not deleted. The program processes input parameters, checks multiple files for matching records, and returns a flag indicating whether activity was found.

1. **Program Entry and Parameter Handling**:
   - **Purpose**: Receives input parameters to identify the customer and control the verification process.
   - **Steps**:
     - Defines a parameter list (`*ENTRY PLIST`) with:
       - `ARKEY` (8 bytes): Key combining company and customer number (e.g., `COCUST`).
       - `BCINST` (1 byte): Billing instruction code, used to determine if sales files should be checked.
       - `FOUND` (1 byte): Output parameter set to indicate whether activity was found (`'A'` for invoices, `'S'` for sales, or blank if no activity).
     - Calls the `EACH` subroutine to perform the activity check.
     - Sets the Last Record indicator (`LR`) and exits via the `OUT` tag.

2. **EACH Subroutine**:
   - **Purpose**: Checks for customer activity in invoice and sales files.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Invoice File Check (`CRDETX`)**:
       - Moves `ARKEY` to a 23-byte key (`KEY21`) for positioning in `CRDETX` (invoice detail file).
       - Uses `SETLL` to position the file pointer at the first record matching `KEY21`.
       - Reads `CRDETX` records in a loop (`RDAGN` tag) until end-of-file (indicator `10`).
       - For each record:
         - Skips deleted records (`ADDEL = 'D'`).
         - Compares the record’s key (`ARDKEY`) with `ARKEY`. If they match and the record is not deleted, sets `FOUND = 'A'` (indicating the customer has invoices) and exits to `ENDDEL`.
     - **Sales File Checks (Conditional on `BCINST = '5'`)**:
       - If `BCINST = '5'`, checks multiple sales files for activity:
         - `SA5FIXD` and `SA5FIXM` (fixed sales data, per `LT02`).
         - `SA5BCXD` and `SA5BCXM` (billing-related sales data, per `JB03`).
         - `SA5DBXD` and `SA5DBXM` (distribution-related sales data, per `JB03`).
         - `SA5COXD` and `SA5COXM` (customer order-related sales data, per `JB03`).
       - For each file:
         - Moves `ARKEY` to a 39-byte key (`SAKEY`) for positioning.
         - Uses `SETLL` to position the file pointer.
         - Reads the file and checks if the record’s key (`SACOCU`) matches `ARKEY`.
         - If a match is found, sets `FOUND = 'S'` (indicating the customer has sales activity) and exits to `ENDDEL`.
     - **Termination**:
       - If no activity is found, `FOUND` remains blank.
       - Exits via `ENDDEL`, closes files, and terminates the program.

### **Business Rules**

The program enforces the following business rules to ensure accurate verification of customer activity before deletion:

1. **Invoice Activity Check**:
   - A customer cannot be deleted if they have active (non-deleted, `ADDEL ≠ 'D'`) invoices in `CRDETX`.
   - If a matching invoice record is found, `FOUND` is set to `'A'`, signaling that deletion is not allowed.

2. **Sales Activity Check**:
   - Sales activity is checked only if the billing instruction code (`BCINST`) is `'5'`.
   - The program checks multiple sales files (`SA5FIXD`, `SA5FIXM`, `SA5BCXD`, `SA5BCXM`, `SA5DBXD`, `SA5DBXM`, `SA5COXD`, `SA5COXM`) for records matching the customer key (`SACOCU = ARKEY`).
   - If a matching record is found in any of these files, `FOUND` is set to `'S'`, indicating that deletion is not allowed due to sales activity.

3. **Key Matching**:
   - The customer key (`ARKEY`) combines company and customer number and is used to match records in both invoice and sales files.
   - Only non-deleted invoice records (`ADDEL ≠ 'D'`) are considered for activity checks.

4. **Sequential File Checking**:
   - The program checks `CRDETX` first for invoices. If no activity is found, it proceeds to check sales files (if `BCINST = '5'`).
   - Sales files are checked in pairs (e.g., `SA5FIXD` and `SA5FIXM`), reflecting different data structures or indexes (per `LT02` and `JB03` revisions).

5. **Output**:
   - The `FOUND` parameter is set to:
     - `'A'` if invoice activity is found.
     - `'S'` if sales activity is found.
     - Blank if no activity is found, indicating the customer may be eligible for deletion.

### **External Programs Called**

The `AR9009` program does not call any external programs. It performs direct file operations on `CRDETX` and the sales files (`SA5FIXD`, `SA5FIXM`, `SA5BCXD`, `SA5BCXM`, `SA5DBXD`, `SA5DBXM`, `SA5COXD`, `SA5COXM`) to check for customer activity.

---

### **Summary**

- **Process Steps**: Receives parameters (`ARKEY`, `BCINST`, `FOUND`), checks `CRDETX` for invoice activity, and, if `BCINST = '5'`, checks multiple sales files (`SA5FIXD`, `SA5FIXM`, `SA5BCXD`, `SA5BCXM`, `SA5DBXD`, `SA5DBXM`, `SA5COXD`, `SA5COXM`) for sales activity. Sets `FOUND` to `'A'` (invoices), `'S'` (sales), or blank (no activity).
- **Business Rules**: Prevents deletion if the customer has active invoices or sales (when `BCINST = '5'`); skips deleted invoice records; checks multiple sales files for comprehensive activity verification.
- **Tables Used**: `CRDETX` (invoices), `SA5FIXD`, `SA5FIXM`, `SA5BCXD`, `SA5BCXM`, `SA5DBXD`, `SA5DBXM`, `SA5COXD`, `SA5COXM` (sales data).
- **External Programs Called**: None.
