The provided document is an RPG/36 program named `AR9006.rpg36.txt`, called from the main OCL script `AR900.ocl36.txt` for the purpose of copying alternate product descriptions from a selected customer to another customer in the **Customer Master Add/Update** process on an IBM midrange system (likely System/36 or AS/400, now IBM i). Below, I will explain the **process steps**, **business rules**, **tables used**, and **external programs called** by this RPG program.

### **Process Steps of the RPG Program**

The `AR9006` program is designed to copy alternate product descriptions (`FMCPDS`) from one customer’s record in the `PFARCUPR` file to another customer’s record in the `PTARCUPR` file, based on matching keys. It is invoked from `AR900` (Customer Master File Maintenance) and `BI900` (Customer Shipto Master File Maintenance). The program operates in a straightforward manner, focusing on reading, validating, and updating/adding records.

1. **Program Entry and Parameter Handling**:
   - **Purpose**: Receives input parameters to identify the source and target customer records.
   - **Steps**:
     - The program defines a parameter list (`*ENTRY PLIST`) with the following parameters:
       - `CO` (2 bytes): Company number.
       - `CUST` (6 bytes): Target customer number.
       - `SHIP` (3 bytes): Target shipto number.
       - `KICUST` (6 bytes): Source customer number (from which to copy descriptions).
       - `KISHIP` (3 bytes): Source shipto number.
     - These parameters are used to construct keys for accessing records in the `PFARCUPR` and `PTARCUPR` files.

2. **Execution of the Main Subroutine (`DOCOPY`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Performs the core logic of copying alternate product descriptions.
   - **Steps**:
     - Calls the `DOCOPY` subroutine to process the copy operation.
     - Sets the Last Record indicator (`LR`) to terminate the program after processing.
     - Proceeds to the `OUT` tag to exit.

3. **DOCOPY Subroutine**:
   - **Purpose**: Copies alternate product descriptions from the source customer to the target customer.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Build Source Key (`CPLM16`)**:
       - Constructs an 8-byte key (`CPLM8`) by combining `CO` (company) and `KICUST` (source customer).
       - Extends to an 11-byte key (`CPLM11`) by appending `KISHIP` (source shipto).
       - Extends to a 16-byte key (`CPLM16`) by appending four blank spaces (per `JB01`, likely for `FMCNTY` container type compatibility).
       - Uses `SETLL` to position the file pointer at the first record in `PFARCUPR` matching `CPLM16`.
     - **Read Source Records**:
       - Enters a loop (`AGNP` tag) to read records from `PFARCUPR` until end-of-file (`EOF`, indicator `10`).
       - Skips records marked as deleted (`FMDEL = 'D'`).
       - Validates that the record matches the source company (`FMCONO = CO`), customer (`FMCUST = KICUST`), and shipto (`FMSHIP = KISHIP`). If any mismatch occurs, skips to the next record (`NOMRP` tag).
     - **Build Target Key (`CPKY16`)**:
       - Constructs an 8-byte key (`CPKY8`) using `CO` and `CUST` (target customer).
       - Extends to an 11-byte key (`CPKY11`) by appending `SHIP` (target shipto).
       - Extends to a 15-byte key (`CPKY15`) by appending `FMPROD` (product code from the source record).
       - Extends to a 16-byte key (`CPKY16`) by appending `FMCNTY` (container type from the source record, per `JB01`).
     - **Check Target Record**:
       - Uses `CHAIN` to locate a matching record in `PTARCUPR` using `CPKY16`.
       - If no record exists (indicator `90` on):
         - Copies the alternate product description (`FMCPDS`) to `CPCPDS`.
         - Writes a new record to `PTARCUPR` using the `ADDREC` exception output.
       - If a record exists (indicator `90` off):
         - Checks if the existing alternate description (`CPCPDS`) is blank.
         - If blank, updates `CPCPDS` with `FMCPDS` and writes the updated record to `PTARCUPR` using the `UPDREC` exception output.
     - **Loop Continuation**:
       - Returns to the `AGNP` tag to process the next record in `PFARCUPR`.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - After processing all matching records, the program exits via the `OUT` tag, setting the `LR` indicator to close files and terminate.

### **Business Rules**

The program enforces the following business rules to ensure accurate copying of alternate product descriptions:

1. **Record Matching**:
   - Only non-deleted records (`FMDEL ≠ 'D'`) from the source file (`PFARCUPR`) are considered for copying.
   - The source record must match the input parameters: company (`FMCONO = CO`), customer (`FMCUST = KICUST`), and shipto (`FMSHIP = KISHIP`).

2. **Target Record Handling**:
   - If a matching record does not exist in `PTARCUPR` (based on company, customer, shipto, product code, and container type), a new record is created with the copied alternate description (`FMCPDS`).
   - If a matching record exists in `PTARCUPR` but its alternate description (`CPCPDS`) is blank, it is updated with the source description (`FMCPDS`).
   - If the existing `CPCPDS` is non-blank, no update is performed (preserving the existing description).

3. **Key Structure**:
   - The key for both files includes company, customer, shipto, product code, and container type (`FMCNTY`, added in `JB01`).
   - The container type (`FMCNTY`) is part of the key to ensure precise matching, reflecting a business requirement to differentiate products by container type.

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - The program ensures that only valid, non-deleted source records are copied to maintain data consistency.
   - The alternate description (`CPCPDS`) is only updated or added if necessary, avoiding unnecessary overwrites.

### **Tables (Files) Used**

The program uses the following files, as defined in the File Specification (`F`) section:

1. **PFARCUPR** (`IF`, Input, 80 bytes, Key at position 2, Logical File):
   - Source file containing customer product records with alternate descriptions.
   - Fields include:
     - `FMDEL` (1 byte): Delete code (`D` for deleted).
     - `FMCONO` (2 bytes): Company number.
     - `FMCUST` (6 bytes): Customer number.
     - `FMSHIP` (3 bytes): Shipto number.
     - `FMPROD` (4 bytes): Product code.
     - `FMCPDS` (30 bytes): Customer product description (alternate description).
     - `FMCNTY` (1 byte): Container type (added in `JB01`).

2. **PTARCUPR** (`UF`, Update/Add, 80 bytes, Key at position 2, Physical File):
   - Target file for adding or updating customer product records.
   - Fields include:
     - `CPDEL` (1 byte): Delete code.
     - `CPCPDS` (30 bytes): Customer product description (target for copying).
     - Other fields (implied by key structure): Company, customer, shipto, product code, and container type.

### **External Programs Called**

The `AR9006` program does not call any external programs. It operates independently, performing direct file operations on `PFARCUPR` and `PTARCUPR` to copy alternate product descriptions.

---

### **Summary**

- **Process Steps**: The program receives parameters for source and target customers, reads non-deleted records from `PFARCUPR`, validates them against input parameters, and either adds new records or updates existing records in `PTARCUPR` with the alternate product description.
- **Business Rules**: Ensures only valid, non-deleted source records are copied; updates target records only if their description is blank; includes container type in the key for precise matching; and preserves existing non-blank descriptions.
- **Tables Used**: `PFARCUPR` (input, source records), `PTARCUPR` (update/add, target records).
- **External Programs Called**: None.
