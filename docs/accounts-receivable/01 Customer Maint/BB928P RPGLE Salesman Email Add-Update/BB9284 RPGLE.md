The RPGLE program `BB9284` is a specialized module within a billing and invoicing system, designed to handle the inactivation and reactivation of salesman ID entries. It is called by the main program `BB928P` (as referenced in the earlier document) to perform these specific operations. The program uses a display file (`bb9284d`) to present a window (`actwdw`) for user interaction and updates the salesman ID record status in the database. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, outline the business rules, list the database tables used, and identify any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the BB9284 Program

The program is structured to display a window for confirming the inactivation or reactivation of a salesman ID record and update the database accordingly. It operates in a single mode, focusing on toggling the record’s status (`smdel`) between active (`A`) and inactive (`I`). Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Parameters**: Receives input parameters:
     - `p$co`: Company number.
     - `p$smid`: Salesman ID.
     - `p$fgrp`: File group (`Z` or `G`).
     - `p$flag`: Return flag to indicate the outcome (e.g., `I` for inactivated, `A` for reactivated).
   - **Field Setup**: Moves input parameters `p$co` and `p$smid` to display file fields (`f$co`, `f$smid`). Initializes `winagn` to `*on` to control the window processing loop, and sets up message handling fields (`dspmsg`, `m@pgmq`, `m@key`).
   - **Keylist**: Defines `klslsm` keylist using `f$co` and `f$smid` for database access.
   - **Date Validation**: Defines a parameter list (`pld010`) for a potential date validation module (`dtp010r`), though it is not used in the provided code.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - **File Overrides**: Based on `p$fgrp` (`G` or `Z`), applies a database override from `ovg` or `ovz` arrays to point to the correct file (`gbbslsm` or `zbbslsm`) using the `QCMDEXC` program.
   - **File Open**: Opens `bbslsm` in update/add mode (`uf a`) with `usropn`.

3. **Retrieve Data (`rtvdta` Subroutine)**:
   - **Record Retrieval**: Chains to `bbslsm` using `klslsm` (company and salesman ID) to retrieve the record.
     - If the record exists (`*in99 = *off`):
       - If `smdel = 'I'` (inactive), sets the display header (`f$hdr`) to "Salesman Id Entry ReActivate" (`hdr(01)`), function key label (`f$fkyd`) to "F22=ReActivate" (`fky(01)`), and `*in72` to `*on` (indicating reactivation is available).
       - Otherwise, sets `f$hdr` to "Salesman Id Entry InActivate" (`hdr(02)`), `f$fkyd` to "F23=InActivate" (`fky(02)`), and `*in73` to `*on` (indicating inactivation is available).

4. **Process Window (`prcwdw` Subroutine)**:
   - **Main Loop**: Runs while `winagn = *on`:
     - **Display Messages**: If `dspmsg = *on`, calls `wrtmsg` to display the message subfile; otherwise, writes `msgclr` to clear the message area.
     - **Display Window**: Displays the `actwdw` window using `exfmt`.
     - **Clear Messages**: If `dspmsg = *on`, calls `clrmsg` to clear the message subfile.
     - **Clear Indicators**: Clears error indicators (`*in50`–`*in69`) using `zero20`.
     - **Process User Input**:
       - **F12 (Exit)**: Sets `winagn` to `*off` to exit the loop without changes.
       - **F22 (ReActivate) or F23 (InActivate)**:
         - Calls `winedt` to validate input (which calls `chkact`).
         - If no errors (`*in50 = *off`), calls `winupd` to update the database and sets `winagn` to `*off` to exit.
       - **Other (e.g., Enter)**: Calls `winedt` to validate input but does not update the database.
   - **Cursor Positioning**: Commented-out code suggests cursor location (`row`, `col`) could be calculated from `csrloc`, but it is not currently used.

5. **Edit Window Input (`winedt` Subroutine)**:
   - Calls `chkact` to perform validation, though `chkact` is currently empty, indicating no specific input validation is implemented.

6. **Check Activity (`chkact` Subroutine)**:
   - Currently empty, likely intended for future validation of the salesman ID’s activity (e.g., checking if the record is linked to other data preventing inactivation).

7. **Update Database (`winupd` Subroutine)**:
   - Processes based on the function key:
     - **F22 (ReActivate)**:
       - Chains to `bbslsm` using `klslsm`.
       - If the record exists (`*in99 = *off`) and is inactive (`smdel = 'I'`), sets `smdel` to `A` (active), updates the record (`bbslsmpf`), and sets `p$flag` to `A`.
     - **F23 (InActivate)**:
       - Chains to `bbslsm` using `klslsm`.
       - If the record exists (`*in99 = *off`) and is not already inactive (`smdel ≠ 'I'`), sets `smdel` to `I` (inactive), updates the record (`bbslsmpf`), and sets `p$flag` to `I`.

8. **Message Handling**:
   - **addmsg**: Sends messages to the program message queue using `QMHSNDPM`, setting `dspmsg` to `*on`.
   - **wrtmsg**: Writes the message subfile control (`msgctl`) with `*in49` enabled.
   - **clrmsg**: Clears the message subfile using `QMHRMVPM`. Commented-out code for saving/restoring `rcdnam` and `pagrrn` suggests it was planned but not needed for the window format.

9. **Program Exit**:
   - Closes all files, sets `*inlr` to `*on`, and returns to the calling program (`BB928P`).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules:
1. **Record Status Toggle**:
   - A salesman ID record can be toggled between active (`smdel = 'A'`) and inactive (`smdel = 'I'`) states.
   - Only inactive records can be reactivated (F22), and only non-inactive records can be inactivated (F23).
2. **Record Existence**:
   - The program checks if the salesman ID record exists in `bbslsm` before allowing status changes.
   - If the record does not exist or is in an invalid state (e.g., already inactive for F23), no update occurs.
3. **User Interface**:
   - The window (`actwdw`) displays a header and function key label based on the record’s current status:
     - Inactive records show "Salesman Id Entry ReActivate" with F22 enabled.
     - Active records show "Salesman Id Entry InActivate" with F23 enabled.
   - F12 allows the user to exit without changes.
4. **Database Integrity**:
   - Uses file overrides to select the correct database file (`gbbslsm` or `zbbslsm`) based on `p$fgrp`.
   - Updates only the `smdel` field in the `bbslsm` record, preserving other fields.
5. **Return Flag**:
   - Sets `p$flag` to `A` for reactivation or `I` for inactivation to inform the calling program (`BB928P`) of the outcome.

### Database Tables Used

The program interacts with the following database file:
1. **bbslsm**: Primary file for salesman ID records, opened in update/add mode (`uf a`) with `usropn`. Used for reading and updating the record status (`smdel`).

### External Programs Called

The program calls the following external program:
1. **QCMDEXC**: Executes the file override command for `bbslsm`.
2. **QMHSNDPM**: Sends messages to the program message queue for error or confirmation display.
3. **QMHRMVPM**: Removes messages from the program message queue.

### Additional Notes
- **Display File**: `bb9284d` is a workstation file using the `PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)` for the user interface, with a single window format (`actwdw`) for inactivation/reactivation.
- **Indicators**: Uses indicators (19, 21–79, 90–99) for screen control and message handling, consistent with `BB928P` and `BB928`. Notably, `*in72` and `*in73` control the display of reactivation/inactivation options.
- **Field Prefixes**: Follows the same naming conventions as `BB928P` and `BB928` (e.g., `f$` for display fields, `p$` for input parameters, `o$` for output parameters).
- **Integration with BB928P**: `BB9284` is called by `BB928P` for option 4 (inactivate/reactivate) to toggle the status of a salesman ID record, returning a flag (`p$flag`) to indicate the result.
- **Empty Subroutine**: The `chkact` subroutine is empty, suggesting that additional validation (e.g., checking for dependencies like vendor links in `BB928P`) was planned but not implemented.

This program is a focused module for toggling the active/inactive status of salesman ID records, complementing the broader functionality of `BB928P` and `BB928` by providing a simple, user-driven interface for status changes.
