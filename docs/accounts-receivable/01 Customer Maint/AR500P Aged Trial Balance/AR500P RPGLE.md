The provided document is an RPGLE (Report Program Generator Language Extended) program, `AR500P.rpgle.txt`, which is called by the OCL program `AR500P.ocl36.txt` to generate an Accounts Receivable (A/R) Aged Trial Balance report. This program handles user input, validates parameters, and prepares data for the report. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the RPGLE Program

The `AR500P` RPGLE program is an interactive program that prompts users for input via a workstation display file, validates the input, and sets up parameters for generating the A/R Aged Trial Balance report. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Header Specifications**:
     - `H DFTACTGRP(*NO)`: Runs in a named activation group, allowing better resource management.
     - `H FIXNBR(*ZONED:*INPUTPACKED)`: Ensures zoned and packed numeric fields are handled correctly during input.
     - `H DFTNAME(AR500P)`: Sets the default program name.
   - **Data Structures**:
     - `msg`: A 40-character array with 19 predefined error messages (loaded via `CTDATA`).
     - `dco`: A 35-character array to store company names (up to 3 companies).
     - `uds`: A data structure defining user input fields (e.g., `kydate`, `kyalco`, `kyco1`, etc.) for report parameters like date, company selection, and report options.
     - `y2kcen` and `y2kcmp`: Variables for Y2K date handling (century and comparison year).

2. **File Declarations**:
   - **AR500PD (Workstation File)**:
     - Defined as `CF E WORKSTN` with a handler (`PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)`), indicating a modernized display file for user interaction, likely using a web-based interface.
   - **ARCONT (Accounts Receivable Control File)**:
     - Defined as `UF F 256 2AIDISK KEYLOC(2)`: A 256-byte file with a 2-byte key (company number `acco`), used for update (`UF`) and accessed by key.
   - **GSCONT (General System Control File)**:
     - Defined as `IF F 512 2AIDISK KEYLOC(2)`: A 512-byte input file with a 2-byte key (company number `gxcono`), likely used for system-wide settings.

3. **Main Processing Logic**:
   - **Initial Workstation File Read**:
     - Checks `qsctl` (control flag). If blank, sets indicators `*IN09` (initial screen) and `*IN01` (display screen), and sets `qsctl` to `'R'`.
     - Otherwise, reads the display file `ar500pfm` and returns if the last record indicator (`*INLR`) is on.
   - **Indicator and Message Initialization**:
     - Clears `msg40` (error message field) and resets indicators `50-62`, `81`, and `90` to `*OFF`.
   - **Cancel Check**:
     - If `*INKG` (cancel key) is on, sets `kycanc` to `'CANCEL'`, turns off `*IN01` and `*IN09`, sets `*INLR` to `*ON`, and exits.
   - **One-Time Setup (Subroutine `onetim`)**:
     - Executed if `*IN09` is on (initial run).
     - Captures current time and date, stores in `kydate`.
     - Reads `ARCONT` to populate `dco` array with up to three company numbers (`acco`) and names (`acname`), skipping deleted records (`acdel = 'D'`).
     - Initializes default parameters:
       - `kyds = 'D'` (detail report).
       - `kyalco = 'ALL'` or `'CO '` (based on `GSCONT` company number `gxcono`).
       - `kyalcs = 'ALL'` (all customers).
       - `kyalsl = 'ALL'` (all salesmen).
       - `kyjobq = 'N'` (no job queue).
       - `kycopy = 01` (one copy).
       - `kyouts = 'O'` (outstanding invoices).
       - `kynod = 'N'` (no NOD report).
       - `kyslcy = 'N'` (no salesman copies).
       - `kyrept = 'C'` (customer sequence).
       - `kyclyn = 'N'` (no credit limit).
     - Releases any locked `ARCONT` records using a blank key (`nulkey`).
   - **Screen Processing (Subroutine `screen1`)**:
     - Executed if `*IN01` is on and `*IN15` is off.
     - Validates user input parameters:
       - **Date Validation**: Calls `@dtedt` to validate `kydate` (MMDDYY format).
       - **Company Selection**:
         - Ensures `kyalco` is `'ALL'` or `'CO '`.
         - If `'CO '`, validates `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3` against `ARCONT` (non-zero, non-deleted records).
         - If `'ALL'`, ensures no company numbers are entered.
       - **Customer Selection**:
         - Ensures `kyalcs` is `'ALL'` or `'SEL'`.
         - If `'SEL'`, requires non-zero `kycs01`, `kycs02`, or `kycs03`.
       - **Outstanding Invoices**:
         - Ensures `kyouts` is `'O'` or blank.
       - **Report Sequence**:
         - Ensures `kyrept` is `'C'`, `'N'`, or `'S'`.
         - If `kyslcy = 'Y'`, requires `kyrept = 'S'`.
       - **Salesmen Selection**:
         - Ensures `kyalsl` is `'ALL'` or `'SEL'`.
         - If `'SEL'`, requires `kyrept = 'S'` and valid `kyfmsl`/`kytosl` (from/to salesman, where `kytosl > kyfmsl`).
       - **Job Queue**:
         - Ensures `kyjobq` is `'Y'` or `'N'`.
       - **Credit Limit**:
         - Ensures `kyclyn` is `'Y'` or `'N'`.
       - **NOD Report**:
         - Ensures `kynod` is `'Y'` or `'N'`.
         - If `kynod = 'Y'`, requires `kyds = 'D'`.
       - **Salesman Copies**:
         - Ensures `kyslcy` is `'Y'` or `'N'`.
       - **Copy Count**:
         - Ensures `kycopy` is non-zero (defaults to 1 if zero).
     - Displays error messages (`msg40`) from the `msg` array if validation fails, setting `*IN81` and appropriate error indicators (`50-62`, `90`).
     - Updates `ARCONT` with `kydate` for non-deleted records if validations pass.
     - Releases locked records using `nulkey`.
   - **Date Validation (Subroutine `@dtedt`)**:
     - Validates `kydate` (MMDDYY format):
       - Breaks down into month (`$month`), day (`$day`), and year (`$yr`).
       - Checks month (1-12).
       - Validates day based on month:
         - February: 29 days for leap years, 28 otherwise.
         - Months 4, 6, 9, 11: 30 days.
         - Others: 31 days.
       - Handles leap year calculations using `y2kcen` and `y2kcmp` for century and year checks.
       - Sets `*IN79` if the date is invalid.

4. **Output and Termination**:
   - Writes to the display file (`ar500pfm`) if `*IN81` is on, displaying errors or updated parameters.
   - Sets `*INLR` to `*ON` to end the program if no further processing is needed.
   - Updates `ARCONT` with the ageing date (`kydate`) for all records.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules for generating the A/R Aged Trial Balance report:
1. **Date Validation**:
   - The ageing date (`kydate`) must be a valid date in MMDDYY format, with proper month, day, and leap year checks.
2. **Company Selection**:
   - Must be `'ALL'` (all companies) or `'CO '` (specific companies).
   - If `'CO '`, at least one valid company number (`kyco1`, `kyco2`, or `kyco3`) must exist in `ARCONT` and not be deleted (`acdel ≠ 'D'`).
   - If `'ALL'`, no company numbers should be specified.
3. **Customer Selection**:
   - Must be `'ALL'` (all customers) or `'SEL'` (selected customers).
   - If `'SEL'`, at least one customer number (`kycs01`, `kycs02`, or `kycs03`) must be non-zero.
4. **Outstanding Invoices**:
   - Must be `'O'` (outstanding invoices only) or blank.
5. **Report Sequence**:
   - Must be `'C'` (customer sequence), `'N'` (name sequence), or `'S'` (salesman sequence).
   - If salesman copies (`kyslcy = 'Y'`), report sequence must be `'S'`.
6. **Salesmen Selection**:
   - Must be `'ALL'` (all salesmen) or `'SEL'` (selected salesmen).
   - If `'SEL'`, report sequence must be `'S'`, and valid from/to salesman numbers (`kyfmsl`, `kytosl`) must be provided, with `kytosl > kyfmsl`.
7. **Job Queue**:
   - Must be `'Y'` (run in batch) or `'N'` (run interactively).
8. **Credit Limit**:
   - Must be `'Y'` (print credit limit) or `'N'` (don’t print).
9. **NOD Report**:
   - Must be `'Y'` (include NOD report) or `'N'` (exclude).
   - If `'Y'`, report type must be detail (`kyds = 'D'`).
10. **Salesman Copies**:
    - Must be `'Y'` (print salesman copies) or `'N'` (don’t print).
11. **Copy Count**:
    - Must be non-zero; defaults to 1 if zero.
12. **Report Type**:
    - Must be `'D'` (detail) or `'S'` (summary); defaults to `'D'` if blank.

### External Programs Called

The RPGLE program does not explicitly call external programs (e.g., via `CALL` operation). However, it interacts with:
- **Profound UI Handler** (`PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)`): Used by the `AR500PD` workstation file for rendering the user interface, indicating a modernized front-end.
- The OCL program (`AR500P.ocl36.txt`) that calls this RPGLE program, passing parameters like `?9?` and `?11?`.

### Additional Notes
- **Y2K Compliance**:
  - The program includes Y2K date handling (`y2kcen`, `y2kcmp`) to ensure correct century calculations for leap years.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Uses a predefined `msg` array for user-friendly error messages displayed via `msg40`.
  - Indicators (`50-62`, `79`, `81`, `90`) control error display and program flow.
- **Record Locking**:
  - The program releases locked `ARCONT` records using a blank key (`nulkey`) to prevent deadlocks.
- **Conversion Notes**:
  - The program was converted using TARGET/400 on 04/11/23, with 221 lines added, 5 modified, and 441 processed, indicating modernization from older RPG/36 or RPG III code.
- **Integration with OCL**:
  - The OCL program (`AR500P.ocl36.txt`) loads and runs `AR500P`, passing parameters (`?9?`, `?11?`) that likely correspond to fields like `kyalco`, `kyco1-3`, or `kyjobq`.

This program sets up and validates parameters for the A/R Aged Trial Balance report, ensuring data integrity before report generation. If you need further analysis (e.g., specific field mappings, report output format, or additional files), please provide more details or related files!
