### List of Use Cases Implemented by AR290A.ocl36.txt

The `AR290A.ocl36.txt` OCL program implements a single primary use case:

1. **Post A/R Salesman Change Transactions**:
   - This use case involves processing changes to salesman assignments in the Accounts Receivable (A/R) system by validating the existence of changes in the `ARSLST` file, processing them into the `SLSCHG` file, and handling user confirmation or cancellation.

### Function Requirement Document



# A/R Salesman Change Posting Function Requirements

## Overview
The `post_ar_salesman_changes` function processes salesman change transactions in the Accounts Receivable (A/R) system, validating and applying updates from the `ARSLST` file to the `SLSCHG` file without user interaction.

## Inputs
- **ARSLST File**: A data file containing pending salesman change transactions (e.g., customer ID, old salesman ID, new salesman ID).
- **SLSCHG File**: A target file for processed salesman change records.
- **System Parameters**: Configuration data specifying file formats and processing rules.

## Outputs
- **Updated SLSCHG File**: Contains processed salesman change records.
- **Status Code**: Indicates success, no changes, or cancellation.
- **Error Message (if applicable)**: Describes any issues encountered (e.g., no records in `ARSLST`).

## Process Steps
1. **Validate ARSLST File**:
   - Check if `ARSLST` contains any salesman change records.
   - If no records exist, return status "No changes to process" and exit.

2. **Process Changes**:
   - If records exist in `ARSLST`, read each record (e.g., customer ID, old salesman ID, new salesman ID).
   - Validate record integrity (e.g., non-null salesman IDs, valid customer references).
   - Write validated records to `SLSCHG` file with specified format (starting at record 1, block size 32).

3. **Complete Posting**:
   - If all records are processed successfully, return status "Posting completed".
   - If processing fails (e.g., file errors), return status "Posting cancelled" with error details.

## Business Rules
- **Data Validation**: Ensure `ARSLST` records contain valid customer and salesman IDs. Invalid records are skipped, and an error is logged.
- **File Integrity**: `SLSCHG` is created or overwritten only if `ARSLST` contains valid records.
- **Atomic Processing**: All changes are processed as a single transaction; partial updates are not allowed.
- **No User Interaction**: The function operates autonomously, assuming all inputs are pre-validated.

## Calculations
- No explicit calculations are performed. The function primarily involves data validation and file manipulation:
  - **Record Count Check**: Determines if `ARSLST` has zero records (`record_count == 0`).
  - **Record Mapping**: Maps `ARSLST` fields (e.g., customer ID, salesman ID) to `SLSCHG` format without transformation.

## Error Handling
- If `ARSLST` is empty or inaccessible, return "No records exist in the change table".
- If `SLSCHG` cannot be created or written to, return "Posting process failed" with error details.
- Log all errors for audit purposes.

## Assumptions
- Input files (`ARSLST`, `SLSCHG`) are accessible and formatted per system specifications.
- No external user input is required; the function processes data autonomously.
