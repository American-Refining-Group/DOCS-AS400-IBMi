The provided document is an OCL (Operation Control Language) program, specifically `AR290A.ocl36.txt`, used in IBM System/36 environments to manage Accounts Receivable (A/R) salesman change transactions. Below, I’ll explain the process steps of the program, identify any external programs called, and list the tables/files used.

### Process Steps of the RPG .OCL Program

The OCL program controls the flow of processing A/R salesman change transactions, handling validation, user interaction, and file operations. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the program’s logic:

1. **Initial Program Identification and Setup**:
   - The program starts with metadata or comments identifying it as the "A/R SALESMAN CHANGE TRANSACTION POST" process (`// * 'A/R SALESMAN CHANGE TRANSACTION POST'`).
   - It likely runs under a specific procedure (`SCPROCP`) and system context (`GSY2K`).

2. **Check for Changes in ARSLST File**:
   - The program checks the `ARSLST` file to determine if there are any salesman change transactions to process (`IFF DATAF1-?9?ARSLST`).
   - **Case 1: No Changes Exist**:
     - If no changes are found (`* 'NO CHANGES EXIST TO BE PROCESSED'`), the program:
       - Checks if the change table (`ARSLST`) has no records (`IF ?F'A,?9?ARSLST'?/0000000 * 'NO RECORDS EXIST IN THE CHANGE TABLE'`).
       - Displays a message indicating the posting process is canceled (`* 'THE POSTING PROCESS HAS BEEN CANCELLED'`).
       - Prompts the user to press `0, ENTER` to continue (`PAUSE 'TO CONTINUE--PRESS 0, ENTER'`).
       - Terminates the program (`CANCEL`).
   - **Case 2: Changes Exist**:
     - If changes are found (`* 'THERE ARE CHANGES TO PROCESS'`), the program:
       - Prompts the user with options to either cancel (press `SHIFT + ATTN, 2, ENTER`) or continue (press `0, ENTER`) (`PAUSE 'TO CANCEL--PRESS SHIFT + ATTN,2,ENTER TO CONTINUE--PRESS 0,ENTER'`).

3. **Processing Changes**:
   - If changes exist and the user chooses to continue, the program checks for the existence of the `SLSCHG` file (`IFF DATAF1-?9?SLSCHG`).
   - It then builds or processes the `SLSCHG` file (`BLDFILE ?9?SLSCHG,S,RECORDS,1,32,,T,,,NDFILE`):
     - `BLDFILE` is an OCL command to create or manipulate a file.
     - Parameters suggest it processes records in the `SLSCHG` file, starting at record 1, with a block size or increment of 32, and other attributes (e.g., `T` for temporary file, `NDFILE` for no direct file).
   - If the `SLSCHG` file is successfully processed, it displays a message: `* 'THE POSTING PROCESS HAS BEEN ACTIVATED'`.
   - If the `SLSCHG` file processing is canceled or fails, it displays: `* 'THE POSTING PROCESS HAS BEEN CANCELLED'`, followed by a pause for user acknowledgment (`PAUSE 'TO CONTINUE--PRESS 0,ENTER'`).

4. **User Interaction and Cancellation**:
   - Throughout the process, the program uses `PAUSE` commands to interact with the user, allowing them to confirm continuation or cancel the process.
   - Cancellation can occur at multiple points, either explicitly by the user (via `SHIFT + ATTN, 2, ENTER`) or implicitly if no records/changes are found.

### External Programs Called

The OCL program itself does not explicitly call external RPG programs in the provided code. The `BLDFILE` command suggests file manipulation, which may involve system utilities or underlying RPG programs, but no specific program names are mentioned. Typically, in System/36 environments, `BLDFILE` is a system command that may invoke internal system routines rather than user-defined RPG programs. Therefore, based on the provided code:

- **External Programs**: None explicitly called.

### Tables/Files Used

The program interacts with the following files/tables:

1. **ARSLST**:
   - Description: Likely the A/R Salesman List or change table, which stores pending salesman change transactions.
   - Role: The program checks this file to determine if changes exist (`DATAF1-?9?ARSLST`) and verifies if it contains records (`?F'A,?9?ARSLST'?/0000000`).

2. **SLSCHG**:
   - Description: A file used to process or store salesman change transactions, possibly a temporary or working file.
   - Role: The program builds or processes this file (`BLDFILE ?9?SLSCHG`) if changes are present in `ARSLST`.

### Summary

- **Process Overview**: The program checks for salesman change transactions in the `ARSLST` file. If no changes exist, it informs the user and cancels. If changes are found, it prompts the user to continue or cancel. On continuation, it processes the changes via the `SLSCHG` file, activating or canceling the posting process based on the outcome.
- **External Programs**: None explicitly called.
- **Tables/Files**: `ARSLST` (salesman change table), `SLSCHG` (processed change file).
