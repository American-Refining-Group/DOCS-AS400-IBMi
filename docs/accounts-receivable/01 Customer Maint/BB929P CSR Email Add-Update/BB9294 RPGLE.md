The `BB9294` RPGLE program is part of the Billing and Invoicing system and is designed to handle the Inactivation and Reactivation of Customer Service Representative (CSR) IDs. It is called by the main program `BB929P` to toggle the status of a CSR record between active (`A`) and inactive (`I`). Below, I will explain the process steps, outline the business rules, list the tables used, and identify any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the RPGLE Program (`BB9294`)

The program is an interactive workstation-based application that uses a display file (`bb9294d`) to present a window format (`actwdw`) for confirming the inactivation or reactivation of a CSR record. It updates the `crdel` field in the `bbcsr` file to reflect the status change. Below is a step-by-step explanation of its process flow, based on the mainline logic and subroutines:

1. **Program Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Parameter Reception**: The program receives four parameters:
     - `p$co`: Company number (input).
     - `p$crid`: CSR ID (input).
     - `p$fgrp` (1 character): File group (`Z` or `G`) for database overrides.
     - `p$flag` (1 character): Return flag (output, set to `A` for reactivation or `I` for inactivation).
   - **Field Initialization**:
     - Moves input parameters `p$co` and `p$crid` to display file fields `f$co` and `f$crid`.
     - Defines key list `klcsr` for accessing the `bbcsr` file using `f$co` and `f$crid`.
     - Sets `winagn` to `*ON` to control the window processing loop.
     - Initializes message handling fields (`dspmsg` to blank, `m@pgmq` to `*`, `m@key` to blanks).
     - Defines a parameter list (`pld010`) for date validation (not used in the provided code).
   - **Commented Test Code**: Includes commented-out code for testing with hardcoded values (e.g., `p$co = '10'`, `p$crid = 'JGK'`).

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - **File Overrides**: Based on `p$fgrp` (`Z` or `G`), applies a database override using the `QCMDEXC` API to redirect access to the `bbcsr` file to either `gbbcsr` or `zbcsr`.
   - **File Opening**: Opens the `bbcsr` file (update/add, keyed access).

3. **Retrieve Data (`rtvdta` Subroutine)**:
   - Chains to `bbcsr` using `klcsr` (`f$co`, `f$crid`) to retrieve the CSR record.
   - If the record exists (`*IN99` is `*OFF`):
     - If `crdel` is `I` (inactive):
       - Sets the header `f$hdr` to "CSR Id Entry ReActivate" (`hdr(01)`).
       - Sets the function key label `f$fkyd` to "F22=ReActivate" (`fky(01)`).
       - Sets `*IN72` to `*ON` (likely for display formatting, e.g., color).
     - If `crdel` is not `I` (active or other status):
       - Sets `f$hdr` to "CSR Id Entry InActivate" (`hdr(02)`).
       - Sets `f$fkyd` to "F23=InActivate" (`fky(02)`).
       - Sets `*IN73` to `*ON`.

4. **Process Window (`prcwdw` Subroutine)**:
   - **Main Loop (`winagn`)**:
     - **Display Messages**: If `dspmsg` is `*ON`, calls `wrtmsg` to display the message subfile; otherwise, writes `msgclr` to clear messages.
     - **Display Window**: Executes `exfmt actwdw` to display the window format and accept user input.
     - **Clear Messages**: If `dspmsg` is `*ON`, calls `clrmsg` to clear the message subfile.
     - **Clear Error Indicators**: Resets indicators `*IN50` to `*IN69` to zero.
     - **Cursor Positioning**: Contains commented-out code for calculating cursor position (`row`, `col`) using `csrloc`.
     - **Process User Input**:
       - **F12 (Exit)**: Sets `winagn` to `*OFF` to exit the loop.
       - **F22 or F23 (ReActivate/InActivate)**:
         - Calls `winedt` to validate input (which calls `chkact`).
         - If no errors (`*IN50` is `*OFF`), calls `winupd` to update the database and sets `winagn` to `*OFF` to exit.
       - **Other (e.g., Enter)**: Calls `winedt` to validate input (no further action unless F22/F23 is pressed).
     - The loop continues until `winagn` is `*OFF`.

5. **Edit Window Input (`winedt` Subroutine)**:
   - Calls `chkact` to check activity prior to status change (no logic implemented in `chkact`).

6. **Check Activity (`chkact` Subroutine)**:
   - Currently empty, likely intended as a placeholder for checking if the CSR ID is used in other tables (e.g., vendor table, as indicated by the `E` flag in `BB929P`).

7. **Update Database (`winupd` Subroutine)**:
   - **ReActivate (F22)**:
     - Chains to `bbcsr` using `klcsr`.
     - If the record exists (`*IN99` is `*OFF`) and `crdel` is `I` (inactive):
       - Sets `crdel` to `A` (active).
       - Updates the `bbcsrpf` record.
       - Sets `p$flag` to `A` to indicate successful reactivation.
   - **InActivate (F23)**:
     - Chains to `bbcsr` using `klcsr`.
     - If the record exists (`*IN99` is `*OFF`) and `crdel` is not `I` (e.g., active):
       - Sets `crdel` to `I` (inactive).
       - Updates the `bbcsrpf` record.
       - Sets `p$flag` to `I` to indicate successful inactivation.

8. **Message Handling (`addmsg`, `wrtmsg`, `clrmsg` Subroutines)**:
   - **Add Message (`addmsg`)**:
     - Sets `dspmsg` to `*ON`.
     - Calculates the length of `m@data` and sends a message to the program message queue using `QMHSNDPM`.
     - Clears message data fields.
   - **Write Message Subfile (`wrtmsg`)**:
     - Sets `*IN49` to `*ON` and writes the `msgctl` format to display messages.
   - **Clear Message Subfile (`clrmsg`)**:
     - Sets `dspmsg` to `*OFF`.
     - Calls `QMHRMVPM` to clear messages (note: saving/restoring `rcdnam` and `pagrrn` is commented out, suggesting a simplified message clearing process).

9. **Program Termination**:
   - Closes all files.
   - Sets `*INLR` to `*ON` and returns.

### Business Rules

The `BB9294` program enforces the following business rules for inactivating or reactivating CSR IDs:

1. **Purpose**:
   - The program toggles the status of a CSR record in the `bbcsr` file by updating the `crdel` field between `A` (active) and `I` (inactive).

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - Requires `p$co` (company number) and `p$crid` (CSR ID) to identify the record.
   - Uses `p$fgrp` to determine the file library (`Z` or `G`).
   - Returns `p$flag` as `A` (reactivated), `I` (inactivated), or unchanged if no action is taken.

3. **Status Toggle**:
   - **ReActivate (F22)**: Only allowed if the record exists and `crdel` is `I`. Sets `crdel` to `A` and updates the record.
   - **InActivate (F23)**: Only allowed if the record exists and `crdel` is not `I`. Sets `crdel` to `I` and updates the record.
   - If the record does not exist (`*IN99` is `*ON`), no update is performed, and `p$flag` remains unchanged.

4. **Activity Check**:
   - The `chkact` subroutine is a placeholder, suggesting a business rule to check for dependencies (e.g., CSR ID used in a vendor table, as indicated by the `E` flag in `BB929P`). However, no logic is implemented, so no validation occurs.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Displays a window (`actwdw`) with a header and function key label that reflect the current record status:
     - If inactive (`crdel = 'I'`), shows "CSR Id Entry ReActivate" and "F22=ReActivate".
     - If active, shows "CSR Id Entry InActivate" and "F23=InActivate".
   - Supports function keys:
     - **F12**: Exits the program without changes.
     - **F22**: Triggers reactivation.
     - **F23**: Triggers inactivation.
   - Provides message feedback using the `GSMSGF` message file (though no specific error messages are used in the provided code).

6. **File Overrides**:
   - Uses `p$fgrp` to apply overrides, redirecting `bbcsr` to `gbbcsr` or `zbcsr` based on the file group.

7. **Message Handling**:
   - Displays messages in a message subfile (`msgctl`) and clears them as needed. The `com` array includes a placeholder error message, but it is not used in the code.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program uses the following files:
1. **bb9294d**:
   - Type: Workstation file (display file).
   - Usage: Contains the `actwdw` format for the inactivation/reactivation window, along with a message subfile (`msgctl`) and clear message format (`msgclr`).
   - Handler: `PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)` for Profound UI integration.
2. **bbcsr**:
   - Type: Physical file (update/add, keyed access).
   - Usage: Stores CSR records, used to retrieve and update the `crdel` field for status changes. Accessed using the key list `klcsr` (`f$co`, `f$crid`).
   - Override: Redirected to `gbbcsr` or `zbcsr` based on `p$fgrp`.

---

### External Programs Called

The program calls the following external program (an IBM i API):
1. **QCMDEXC**:
   - Purpose: Executes the file override command to redirect `bbcsr` to the appropriate library.
   - Parameters:
     - `dbov##` (80 characters, override command).
     - `dbol##` (15.5, command length).
2. **QMHSNDPM**:
   - Purpose: Sends messages to the program message queue for display in the message subfile.
   - Parameters: Message ID, message file, message data, data length, message type, program queue, stack counter, message key, error code.
3. **QMHRMVPM**:
   - Purpose: Clears messages from the program message queue.
   - Parameters: Program queue, stack counter, message key, remove option, error code.

### Summary

The `BB9294` RPGLE program, called by `BB929P`, is responsible for toggling the status of CSR ID records between active (`A`) and inactive (`I`) in the `bbcsr` file. It presents a confirmation window (`actwdw`) with dynamic headers and function key labels based on the current record status, allowing users to reactivate (F22) or inactivate (F23) a record. The program enforces rules to ensure status changes are only applied to existing records with the appropriate current status, and it uses file overrides to access the correct library (`Z` or `G`). It interacts with two files: `bb9294d` (display) and `bbcsr` (CSR data), and relies on IBM i APIs (`QCMDEXC`, `QMHSNDPM`, `QMHRMVPM`) for file overrides and message handling. The `chkact` subroutine suggests a potential business rule for dependency checking, but it is not implemented in the provided code.
