The `AR291.rpg36.txt` is an RPG (Report Program Generator) program for IBM System/36, invoked by the `AR290.ocl36.txt` OCL program to update salesman codes in batch order files (`BBOR01` to `BBOR98`). Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AR291 RPG Program

The `AR291` RPG program updates salesman codes from an old code (`ASSLSO`) to a new code (`ASSLSN`) in the batch order file (`BBORTR`, dynamically representing `BBOR01` to `BBOR98`) for records matching specific customer and company numbers. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization (Lines 0034–0041)**:
   - **ONCE Routine**: Executes once at program start (controlled by `ONCE` flag set to `1`).
     - Captures the current time (`TIMEX`, 12 digits) and moves it to:
       - `TIMEOF` (6 digits, HHMMSS) for potential logging.
       - `DATE` (6 digits, likely MMDDYY or YYMMDD, depending on system format).
   - **Purpose**: Sets up timestamp data, though it’s not used in output in this program (possibly for future logging or compatibility).

2. **Main Processing Loop (Lines 0044–0050)**:
   - **Loop Control**: Processes each record in the `ARSLST` file (salesman change transaction file) where the delete flag (`ASDEL`) is not set (`NCD` condition, record type `01`).
   - **Subroutines Called**:
     - `ARCUST`: Validates the customer in the customer master file.
     - `BBORTR`: Updates the salesman code in the batch order file (`BBORTR`).
   - **Condition**: The `BBORTR` subroutine is executed only if the customer record is found in `ARCUST` (`N90` condition, i.e., `ASKEY` exists).

3. **ARCUST Subroutine (Lines 0057–0065)**:
   - **Process**:
     - Chains (searches) the `ARCUST` file using `ASKEY` (company and customer number from `ARSLST`).
     - If the customer is found (`N90`), no updates are made to `ARCUST` in this program (unlike `AR290`).
     - If the old salesman code (`ASSLSO`) is zero, sets it to the current salesman code (`SLMN`) from `ARCUST` for tracking.
   - **Purpose**: Validates the customer and ensures the old salesman code is populated for reference, even though `ARCUST` is not updated in this program.

4. **BBORTR Subroutine (Lines 0068–0092)**:
   - **Process**:
     - Initializes a key (`KEY11`, 11 bytes) to blank and sets the lower limit (`SETLL`) on the `BBORTR` file to position the file pointer.
     - Enters a loop (`AGNBBO` tag):
       - Reads `BBORTR` records sequentially until no more records are found (`91` indicator).
       - For each record:
         - Checks if the company (`CO`) matches `ASCO` and the customer (`CUST`) matches `ASCUST` from `ARSLST`.
         - If matched, updates the salesman code (`SLSM`) to the new code (`ASSLSN`) and writes the updated record (`EXCPT BBO`).
         - Increments the counter `ASORT` to track the number of updated records.
       - Loops back to read the next record (`GOTO AGNBBO`).
   - **Purpose**: Updates the salesman code in the batch order file for matching records.

5. **Update ARSLST Counter (Lines 0099–0100)**:
   - **Process**:
     - For each `ARSLST` record processed (`01N90`), updates the record (`EXCPT`) with the count of updated batch order records (`ASORT`).
   - **Purpose**: Tracks the number of updates for reporting in the `AR299` program.

### Business Rules
1. **Update Criteria**:
   - Updates are applied to `BBORTR` records where the company number (`CO`) and customer number (`CUST`) match the `ARSLST` record’s `ASCO` and `ASCUST`.
   - Prior to the MG04 change (09/26/2017), updates also required the salesman code (`SLSM`) to match the old salesman code (`ASSLSO`). This check was commented out, so updates now depend only on customer and company numbers.
   - The new salesman code (`ASSLSN`) replaces the existing salesman code (`SLSM`) in the `BBORTR` file.

2. **File Scope**:
   - The program processes one batch order file at a time (`BBORTR`, representing `BBOR01` to `BBOR98`), as invoked by the OCL program’s loop.
   - The `ARCUST` file is used for validation only, not updated.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If a customer record is not found in `ARCUST` (`90` indicator), no updates are performed in `BBORTR` for that customer.
   - Records in `ARSLST` marked for deletion (`ASDEL`) are skipped.

4. **Audit and Tracking**:
   - The `ASORT` counter tracks the number of records updated in `BBORTR` and is stored in `ARSLST` for reporting.

5. **Data Integrity**:
   - The `BBORTR` file is opened in update mode (`UF`) with shared access (from OCL `DISP-SHRMM`), allowing concurrent access while ensuring updates are committed.
   - The program uses `SETLL` and `READ` for sequential processing, ensuring all matching records are updated.

### Tables/Files Used
The program interacts with the following files, as defined in the File Specification (F-spec) and used in processing:
1. **ARSLST** (Input/Update, 256 bytes, Key: 8 bytes):
   - Salesman change transaction file containing company number (`ASCO`), customer number (`ASCUST`), old salesman code (`ASSLSO`), new salesman code (`ASSLSN`), and a counter for batch order updates (`ASORT`).
2. **ARCUST** (Input, 384 bytes, Key: 8 bytes):
   - Customer master file, used to validate customers and retrieve the current salesman code (`SLMN`) if `ASSLSO` is zero.
3. **BBORTR** (Update, 512 bytes, Key: 11 bytes):
   - Batch order file (represents `BBOR01` to `BBOR98`), updated with the new salesman code (`SLSM`).

### External Programs Called
- **None**: The `AR291` RPG program does not call any external programs. It is a standalone program invoked by the `AR290.ocl36.txt` OCL program and performs all processing internally through its subroutines.

### Additional Notes
- **File Modifications**:
  - **MG04 (09/26/2017)**: Removed the salesman code comparison (`SLSM IFEQ ASSLSO`), making updates based solely on customer and company numbers, aligning with the change in `AR290`.
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - The program processes `BBORTR` sequentially using `SETLL` and `READ`, typical for System/36 but potentially slow for large datasets.
  - Shared access (`DISP-SHRMM` in OCL) ensures concurrent access but requires careful transaction management.
- **Legacy Context**:
  - This RPG III program is designed for the IBM System/36 or AS/400, using fixed-format code with cycle-based processing.
  - The use of `EXCPT` for output and `CHAIN` for random access is standard for RPG on this platform.
- **Role in OCL**:
  - `AR291` is called repeatedly by the OCL program for each batch file (`BBOR01` to `BBOR98`), handling one file per invocation.

This program ensures consistent salesman code updates in batch order files, validates customers against the master file, and tracks update counts for reporting, supporting the accounts receivable system’s need for accurate salesman assignments.
