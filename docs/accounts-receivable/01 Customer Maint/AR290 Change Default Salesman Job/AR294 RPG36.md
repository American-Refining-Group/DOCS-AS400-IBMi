The `AR294.rpg36.txt` is an RPG (Report Program Generator) program for IBM System/36, invoked by the `AR290.ocl36.txt` OCL program to retrieve the next invoice transaction file name from a catalog file (`AR29WS`) and mark it as processed. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AR294 RPG Program

The `AR294` RPG program is a simple utility that processes the catalog file `AR29WS` to extract the name of the next invoice transaction file and updates the catalog to indicate it has been processed. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Read Catalog File (Lines 0006–0015)**:
   - **Process**:
     - Reads the next record from the `AR29WS` file where the record is not marked as processed (`NCY`, i.e., the `CY` field at position 22 is not 'Y').
     - Additional conditions ensure the record is valid:
       - Positions 3–4 must match the value in `CB` (likely a control field).
       - Positions 5–6 must match the value in `CT` and `CR` (likely type and record indicators).
     - Extracts the file label (`LABEL`, positions 1–8) from the record.
   - **Purpose**: Identifies the next unprocessed invoice transaction file name from the catalog.

2. **Store File Label in LDA (Lines 0011–0012)**:
   - **Process**:
     - Moves the extracted `LABEL` (positions 1–8) to the Local Data Area (LDA, `UDS`, positions 1–8).
   - **Purpose**: Makes the file label available to the calling OCL program for use in subsequent steps (e.g., to open the invoice transaction file in `AR295`).

3. **Mark Record as Processed (Lines 0015–0019)**:
   - **Process**:
     - Updates the current `AR29WS` record (`EXCPT` operation with `01` condition) by setting position 22 to `'Y'`, indicating the file has been processed.
     - Sets the Last Record (`LR`) indicator to terminate the program after processing one record.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures the same file is not processed again in subsequent iterations of the OCL loop.

### Business Rules
1. **Selection Criteria**:
   - Only unprocessed records (`CY` ≠ 'Y' at position 22) in `AR29WS` are read.
   - Records must satisfy additional conditions based on control fields (`CB`, `CT`, `CR`) to be considered valid, ensuring only relevant invoice transaction file names are selected.

2. **Single Record Processing**:
   - The program processes one record per execution, retrieving the next unprocessed file name and marking it as processed.
   - The `LR` indicator ensures the program terminates after processing a single record.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - The `AR29WS` file is opened in update mode (`UP`) to allow reading and updating the processed flag.
   - The file label is stored in the LDA for use by the OCL program, ensuring accurate communication between programs.

4. **No Duplicates**:
   - The program assumes the catalog file does not allow duplicate keys, ensuring unique file names are processed.

### Tables/Files Used
The program interacts with the following file:
1. **AR29WS** (Update, 132 bytes, No Key):
   - Catalog file containing invoice transaction file names.
   - Key fields:
     - `LABEL` (positions 1–8): The file name of the invoice transaction file.
     - Position 22 (`CY`): Flag indicating whether the file has been processed ('Y' for processed, blank or other for unprocessed).
     - Positions 3–4 (`CB`), 5–6 (`CT`, `CR`): Control fields for validating records.

### External Programs Called
- **None**: The `AR294` RPG program does not call any external programs. It is a standalone utility invoked by the `AR290.ocl36.txt` OCL program to retrieve and mark invoice transaction file names.

### Additional Notes
- **Role in OCL**:
  - `AR294` is called within the OCL program’s loop (`LOOP` tag) to fetch the next invoice transaction file name for processing by `AR295`.
  - The OCL program uses the `LABEL` stored in the LDA to dynamically open the corresponding invoice transaction file (`BBTRAN`).
- **Simplicity**:
  - The program is lightweight, designed to perform a single task: retrieve one file name and mark it as processed.
  - It relies on the OCL program to manage the loop and invoke subsequent processing (`AR295`).
- **Legacy Context**:
  - This RPG III program is designed for the IBM System/36, using fixed-format code with cycle-based processing.
  - The use of `EXCPT` for output and the LDA for inter-program communication is typical for System/36 RPG programs.
- **Data Area (LDA)**:
  - The Local Data Area (`UDS`) is used to pass the file label back to the OCL program, a common mechanism for data exchange in System/36.

This program supports the accounts receivable system by providing the next invoice transaction file name for salesman code updates, ensuring each file is processed exactly once in a controlled manner.
