The provided call stack consists of three programs: `AR201P.ocl36.txt` (main OCL program), `AR200P.rpgle.txt` (RPGLE program for journal date input and validation), and `AR201.ocl36.txt` (OCL program for A/R transaction posting). Together, these programs implement a process for posting Accounts Receivable (A/R) transactions, including invoices and adjustments, to customer and general ledger files. Below, I’ll identify the use case(s) implemented by this call stack and then provide a function requirement document for a non-interactive version of the process, assuming inputs are provided programmatically.

### Use Cases Implemented
The call stack implements a single primary use case:
1. **Post A/R Transactions (Invoices and Adjustments)**:
   - **Description**: This use case allows the system to accept a journal date, validate it, sort A/R transactions, post them to customer, detail, history, and distribution files, generate journal entries (sales or cash receipts), post to the general ledger, and produce reports (transaction register and general ledger posting reports).
   - **Scope**: The process starts with user input for a journal date (`AR200P`), validates it, and proceeds to process transactions (`AR201`) based on the provided date, updating relevant files and generating reports.
   - **Inputs**: Journal date (from user or system), A/R transaction data (from `?9?ARTRGG` file).
   - **Outputs**: Updated customer, detail, history, distribution, and general ledger files; transaction register and general ledger posting reports.

No additional distinct use cases are evident, as the programs focus on a single end-to-end process for A/R transaction posting.

### Function Requirement Document
The following document reimagines the interactive A/R transaction posting process as a non-interactive function that accepts inputs programmatically and completes the process without screen interaction.



# A/R Transaction Posting Function Requirements

## Overview
The `PostARTransactions` function processes Accounts Receivable (A/R) transactions (invoices and adjustments) by validating a provided journal date, sorting transactions, posting them to customer and general ledger files, generating journal entries, and producing reports. The function operates non-interactively, receiving all inputs programmatically.

## Inputs
- **Journal Date**: A 6-digit numeric value in `MMDDYY` format (e.g., 073025 for July 30, 2025).
- **Environment Prefix**: A 1-character code (e.g., 'G' for production, other for test) to determine output queue and file naming.
- **Transaction File (`?prefix?ARTRGG`)**: A file containing A/R transactions with fields:
  - Position 1: Record type (exclude 'C' or 'D').
  - Position 54: Additional type (exclude 'C' or 'E').
  - Positions 7–8: Company code (`TRCO`).
  - Positions 191–192: Invoice class code (`TRICCD`).
  - Position 31: Transaction type (`TRTYPE`).
  - Positions 9–21: Customer number and invoice number (`TRCUST/TRINV#`).

## Outputs
- **Updated Files**:
  - `?prefix?ARCUST`: Customer master file (balances, status).
  - `?prefix?ARDETL`: A/R detail file (transaction details).
  - `?prefix?ARHIST`: A/R history file (transaction records).
  - `?prefix?ARDIGG`: A/R distribution file (accounting distributions).
  - `?prefix?ARCONT`: A/R control file (control totals).
  - `?prefix?TEMGEN`: General ledger temporary file.
  - `?prefix?GLMAST`: General ledger master file (posted journal entries).
  - `?prefix?ARDALY` (optional): A/R daily file, if created.
- **Reports**:
  - Transaction Register: Details of posted A/R transactions.
  - General Ledger Posting Report: Summarizes journal entries.
- **Temporary Files (Deleted Post-Process)**:
  - `?prefix?AR201S`: Sorted transaction file.
  - `?prefix?ARTGGG`: Temporary journal file.
  - `?prefix?AR211S`: Sorted journal file.
  - `?prefix?ARTRGG`: Input transaction file (scratched after processing).

## Process Steps
1. **Initialize Environment**:
   - Validate the environment prefix and set file labels using the prefix and journal date (e.g., `G073025ARTRGG`).
   - Ensure Y2K-compliant date handling for all operations.

2. **Validate Journal Date**:
   - Check that the input journal date is in `MMDDYY` format and valid:
     - Month: 1–12.
     - Day: ≤ 31 (or ≤ 30 for April, June, September, November; ≤ 28 or 29 for February, based on leap year).
     - Leap Year Calculation:
       - If year ≠ 00, year is divisible by 4.
       - If year = 00, combine with century (e.g., `y2kcen`) and check if divisible by 400.
     - If invalid, return error code with message "INVALID DATE" and abort.

3. **Sort A/R Transactions**:
   - Read input file `?prefix?ARTRGG`.
   - Filter records: Exclude where position 1 = 'C' or 'D' or position 54 = 'C' or 'E'.
   - Sort by:
     - Company code (`TRCO`, positions 7–8).
     - Invoice class code (`TRICCD`, positions 191–192).
     - Transaction type (`TRTYPE`, position 31).
     - Customer/invoice number (`TRCUST/TRINV#`, positions 9–21).
   - Output sorted records to `?prefix?AR201S`.

4. **Post A/R Transactions**:
   - Process sorted transactions from `?prefix?AR201S`.
   - Update:
     - `?prefix?ARCUST`: Customer balances and status.
     - `?prefix?ARDETL`: Transaction details (e.g., invoice amounts, dates).
     - `?prefix?ARHIST`: Transaction history records.
     - `?prefix?ARDIGG`: Accounting distributions (e.g., debit/credit accounts).
     - `?prefix?ARCONT`: Control totals or parameters.
   - Generate Transaction Register report, routed to:
     - `QUSRSYS/ARPOST` if prefix = 'G'.
     - `QUSRSYS/TESTOUTQ` otherwise.

5. **Generate Journal Entries**:
   - Process `?prefix?ARDIGG` to create sales journal (S/J) or cash receipt (C/R) entries.
   - Output journal entries to `?prefix?ARTGGG`.
   - Update `?prefix?ARCONT` with journal control data.

6. **Sort Journal Entries**:
   - Read `?prefix?ARTGGG`.
   - Sort by:
     - Company code (`GDCO`, positions 2–3).
     - Journal/reference number (`JRNL/REF`, positions 4–7).
     - Summary flag (position 96).
     - Account number (positions 13–20).
     - Credit/debit code (position 12).
   - Output sorted entries to `?prefix?AR211S`.

7. **Post to General Ledger**:
   - Process `?prefix?AR211S` and `?prefix?ARTGGG`.
   - Update:
     - `?prefix?TEMGEN`: Temporary general ledger entries.
     - `?prefix?GLMAST`: General ledger accounts (e.g., debits/credits).
     - `?prefix?ARDALY` (if exists): Daily A/R summary.
     - `?prefix?ARCONT`: Control totals.
   - Generate General Ledger Posting Report, routed as per step 4.

8. **Cleanup**:
   - Delete temporary files (`?prefix?ARTRGG`, `?prefix?AR201S`, `?prefix?ARTGGG`, `?prefix?AR211S`).
   - If `?prefix?ARDALY` exists, create it with 1,000 records (96 bytes each) before general ledger posting.

## Business Rules
1. **Journal Date Validation**:
   - Must be a valid date in `MMDDYY` format.
   - Invalid dates abort the process with an error message.

2. **Transaction Filtering**:
   - Exclude records where position 1 = 'C' or 'D' or position 54 = 'C' or 'E' to ensure only valid A/R transactions are processed.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Transactions sorted by company, invoice class, transaction type, and customer/invoice number.
   - Journal entries sorted by company, journal/reference, summary flag, account number, and credit/debit code.

4. **File Updates**:
   - Update customer, detail, history, distribution, and general ledger files with accurate transaction and journal data.
   - Maintain control totals in `?prefix?ARCONT`.

5. **Reporting**:
   - Generate transaction register and general ledger reports, routed to production (`ARPOST`) or test (`TESTOUTQ`) queue based on environment prefix.

6. **Temporary File Management**:
   - Temporary files are retained for the job duration and deleted afterward.
   - Daily file (`?prefix?ARDALY`) is optional and built only if required.

7. **Y2K Compliance**:
   - Use century data (`y2kcen`, `y2kcmp`) for accurate date and leap year calculations.

## Error Handling
- **Invalid Journal Date**: Return error code and message "INVALID DATE".
- **File Access Errors**: Abort if any required file (`?prefix?ARTRGG`, `?prefix?ARCUST`, etc.) is unavailable.
- **Sort Failures**: Abort if sorting fails due to invalid data or resource limits.
- **Report Output**: Ensure reports are generated even if partial processing occurs, with errors noted.

## Assumptions
- Input transaction file (`?prefix?ARTRGG`) is pre-populated with valid A/R data.
- All database files (`?prefix?ARCUST`, `?prefix?ARDETL`, etc.) are accessible and correctly formatted.
- Environment prefix determines file naming and output queue, defaulting to test if not 'G'.



### Notes
- **Non-Interactive Design**: The function replaces the interactive screen prompts (`AR200P`) with programmatic input for the journal date, streamlining the process for batch or automated execution.
- **Calculations**: The primary calculation is the journal date validation, including leap year checks using century data. Other calculations (e.g., transaction amounts, ledger postings) are assumed to occur within `AR200`, `AR210`, and `AR211`, but specific details require their source code.
- **File Prefixing**: The `?prefix?` (e.g., `G073025`) combines the environment prefix and journal date, ensuring unique file labels per run.
- **Extensibility**: The function can be adapted for API integration or scheduled batch jobs by passing inputs via parameters.
