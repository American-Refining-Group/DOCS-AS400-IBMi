The provided document, `AR211.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG III program used in an IBM AS/400 or iSeries environment, called by the OCL script `AR201.ocl36.txt`. Its primary function is to process sorted journal entries from the temporary general ledger file (`ARTEMG` and `AR211S`), summarize them by account number if required, post them to the general ledger temporary file (`TEMGEN`) and daily transaction file (`ARDALY`), and print sales and cash receipts journals. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program (AR211)

The `AR211` program processes journal entries, accumulates totals, and generates reports for sales (`SJ`) and cash receipts (`CR`) journals. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Files Defined**:
     - Input: `ARTEMG` (primary input, 128 bytes), `AR211S` (sorted journal entries, 300 bytes, indexed), `GLMAST` (G/L master, 256 bytes, keyed, shared), `ARCONT` (A/R control, 256 bytes, keyed, shared).
     - Output: `TEMGEN` (G/L temporary file, 128 bytes), `ARDALY` (daily transaction file, 96 bytes), `REPORT` (primary journal report, 132 bytes), `REPORTP` (Indianola copy, 132 bytes).
   - **Data Structures**:
     - `UDS`: User data structure with journal date (`JRNLDT`), user ID (`USERID`), workstation ID (`WSID`), ledger journal type (`LDJTYP`), journal number (`LDJRN#`), ledger retention flag (`LDRETL`), and Y2K variables (`Y2KCEN` = 19, `Y2KCMP` = 80).
     - `MN`: Month names array (January–December) for report formatting.
   - **Subroutines**:
     - `L4DET`: Initializes for each journal date/month.
     - `JRNL`: Writes journal entries.
     - `L4TOT`: Writes journal totals.

2. **Detail Processing (`L4DET`)**:
   - Executes at level break `L4` (change in journal year `GDYR` or month `GDMO`).
   - Captures system time (`TIMEOF`) and date (`TIMDAT`), converts to YMD format (`SYSDT8`, CCYYMMDD).
   - Resets page counter (`PAGE`) to 0.
   - Applies Y2K compliance to journal year (`GDYY`):
     - If `GDYY >= Y2KCMP (80)`, sets century (`GCN`) to `Y2KCEN (19)`; otherwise, increments `Y2KCEN` by 1.
   - Chains to `ARCONT` using company code (`GDCO`) to retrieve control data (e.g., `ACARJ#`, `ACSLJ#`, G/L accounts).
   - Sets journal type (`JRNTYP`) and number (`JRN#`) based on `GDJTYP` (`SJ` or `CR`) and `GDJRN#`.
   - Sets indicators `61` (sales journal) or `63` (cash receipts journal).
   - Writes report header (indicator `11`), clears `11`.
   - Resets level 4 totals (`L4CR$`, `L4DB$`) to 0.

3. **Main Processing Loop**:
   - Processes `ARTEMG` records sequentially, with level breaks:
     - **L6 (Company Change)**: Not explicitly handled but triggers `L4`.
     - **L5 (Journal Type/Number Change)**: Not explicitly handled but triggers `L4`.
     - **L4 (Year/Month Change)**: Executes `L4DET` and `L4TOT`.
     - **L3 (Summarization Flag Change)**: Checks if `GDSUMM = 'S'` (indicator `20` for summarized entries).
     - **L2 (Account Change)**: Resets level 2 totals (`L2CR$`, `L2DB$`, `L2TOT$`).
     - **L1 (Detail Record)**: Accumulates amount (`GDAMT`) to `L1TOT$`.
   - Converts journal date (`GDDATE`) to YMD format (`CYMD`, CCYYMMDD) with Y2K compliance.

4. **Non-Summarized Entries (`N20`)**:
   - Checks if entry is credit (`GDCRDB = 'C'`, indicator `15`).
   - Adds `L1TOT$` to `L2CR$` (credit) or `L2DB$` (debit).
   - Executes `JRNL` to write the entry.
   - Resets `L1TOT$`, `L2CR$`, `L2DB$`, `L2TOT$`.

5. **Summarized Entries (`20`)**:
   - At `L1`, accumulates `L1TOT$` to `L2CR$` (credit, `15`) or `L2DB$` (debit, `N15`).
   - At `L2`, executes `JRNL` to write summarized entry.

6. **Journal Entry Writing (`JRNL`)**:
   - Builds G/L key (`KEY11 = GDCO + GDACCT + 'C'`) and chains to `GLMAST` to retrieve account description (`GLDESC`).
   - Calculates net total (`L2TOT$ = L2CR$ - L2DB$` if `15`, or `L2DB$ - L2CR$` if `N15`).
   - If non-zero (`N40`), increments journal sequence (`JRNSEQ`) and writes to `TEMGEN` and `ARDALY` (indicator `WRITIT`).
   - Adds `L2TOT$` to `L4CR$` (credit) or `L4DB$` (debit).

7. **Totals Processing (`L4TOT`)**:
   - If records were read (`GDCO ≠ 0`) and no entries written (`JRNSEQ = 0`), increments `JRNSEQ` and writes a journal entry.
   - Writes journal totals to `REPORT` and `REPORTP` with `L4DB$` and `L4CR$`.

8. **Output Operations**:
   - **TEMGEN**: Writes G/L entries with company (`GDCO`), account (`GDACCT`), journal type (`JRNTYP`), number (`JRN#`), sequence (`JRNSEQ`), debit/credit type, description, date, and amount (`L2TOT$`).
   - **ARDALY**: Writes daily transactions with similar fields.
   - **REPORT/REPORTP**: Prints sales or cash receipts journal with headers (company, date, time, user ID, journal type), detail lines (journal number, date, description, debit/credit amounts), and totals.

### Business Rules

1. **Journal Types**:
   - Sales Journal (`SJ`, indicator `61`): Processes invoices and adjustments.
   - Cash Receipts Journal (`CR`, indicator `63`): Processes payments and miscellaneous cash.
   - Determined by `GDJTYP` from `ARTEMG`.

2. **Summarization**:
   - If `GDSUMM = 'S'` (`20`), accumulates amounts by account (`GDACCT`) at `L2` and writes a single entry.
   - If `N20`, writes individual entries without summarization.

3. **Debit/Credit Handling**:
   - Credit entries (`GDCRDB = 'C'`, `15`): Accumulate to `L2CR$`, `L4CR$`.
   - Debit entries (`N15`): Accumulate to `L2DB$`, `L4DB$`.
   - Net total (`L2TOT$`) determines if entry is written (`N40`).

4. **Y2K Compliance**:
   - Converts journal date (`GDDATE`) to CCYYMMDD format (`CYMD`) using `Y2KCEN` (19) and `Y2KCMP` (80).

5. **G/L Validation**:
   - Chains to `GLMAST` to retrieve account description (`GLDESC`) for reporting.

6. **Journal Sequence**:
   - Increments `JRNSEQ` for each non-zero entry or at totals if no entries were written.

7. **Reporting**:
   - Produces two journal reports (`REPORT`, `REPORTP`) with headers, detail lines (journal number, date, G/L account, description, debit/credit amounts), and totals.
   - Includes company name (`ACNAME`), user ID, workstation ID, and system date/time.

8. **ARCONT Update (Removed)**:
   - Per 8/06/14 change, `ARCONT` is no longer updated (previously updated journal numbers `ACARJ#`, `ACSLJ#`).

9. **Description Handling**:
   - Per 4/20/05 change, retains full 25-character description (`GDDESC`) from cash receipts, with date in the second description field in `TEMGEN`.

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files (tables):
1. **Input Files**:
   - `ARTEMG` (F-spec 0009): Temporary general ledger file (128 bytes, primary input) from `AR210` (`?9?ARTGGG`).
   - `AR211S` (0010): Sorted journal entries (300 bytes, indexed, extension of `ARTEMG`, `?9?AR211S`).
   - `GLMAST` (0011): General ledger master file (256 bytes, keyed by company/account, shared access, `?9?GLMAST`).
   - `ARCONT` (0014): A/R control file (256 bytes, keyed by company, shared access, `?9?ARCONT`).

2. **Output Files**:
   - `TEMGEN` (0012): General ledger temporary file (128 bytes, `?9?TEMGEN`).
   - `ARDALY` (0013): Daily transaction file (96 bytes, `?9?ARDALY`).
   - `REPORT` (0015): Primary journal report (132 bytes, printer file).
   - `REPORTP` (0016): Indianola copy of journal report (132 bytes, printer file).

3. **Compile-Time Data**:
   - `MN`: Month names array (January–December) for report formatting.

### External Programs Called

The program **does not explicitly call external programs** using `CALL` operations. All processing is handled internally via subroutines:
- `L4DET`: Initializes for journal date/month changes.
- `JRNL`: Writes journal entries to `TEMGEN` and `ARDALY`.
- `L4TOT`: Writes journal totals.

### Notes
- **Modifications**:
  - 4/20/05: Enhanced description field handling to retain 25 characters from cash receipts, with date in second description field in `TEMGEN`.
  - 8/06/14: Removed `ARCONT` updates and changed printer names for paperless reporting, with output still printing in Bradford.
- **Indicators**:
  - `61`: Sales journal.
  - `63`: Cash receipts journal.
  - `15`: Credit entry.
  - `20`: Summarized entry.
  - `40`: Non-zero net total.
- **File Access**: `GLMAST` and `ARCONT` are shared (`DISP-SHR`) for concurrent access.
- **Output**: Reports are formatted for clarity, with separate sections for sales and cash receipts journals.
