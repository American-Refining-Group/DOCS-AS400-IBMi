The provided document, `AR200.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG III program used in an IBM AS/400 or iSeries environment, called by the OCL script `AR201.ocl36.txt`. It processes accounts receivable (A/R) transactions, updates customer and detail files, generates journal entries, and prints a transaction posting register. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program (AR200)

The `AR200` program processes A/R transactions (invoices, adjustments, payments, and miscellaneous cash) from a sorted transaction file, updates relevant files, and produces a detailed posting register. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Files Defined**:
     - Input: `ARTRAN` (transactions), `ARDETL` (A/R details), `ARCUST` (customer master), `ARCONT` (A/R control).
     - Output: `ARHIST` (A/R history), `ARDIST` (distribution for journal entries), `REPORT` (primary posting register), `REPORTP` (Pittsburgh copy).
   - **Data Structures**:
     - `UDS`: User data structure for journal date (`JRNLDT`, positions 100–105), user ID (`USERID`), workstation ID (`WSID`), journal type (`SJTYPE`), journal number (`SJ##`), and Y2K variables (`Y2KCEN`, `Y2KCMP`).
     - `AGE`: Array for aged customer balances (5 periods, 9.2 format).
     - `MN`: Month names array (January–December).
   - **Initialization (Level L3)**:
     - Clears accumulators (`Z2`, `ZERO6`, `ZERO7`, `ZERO9`) and sets constants (`ONE1`, `ONE2`).
     - Initializes page counters (`PAGE`, `PAGE2`, `PAGE4`) to 0.
     - Chains to `ARCONT` by company (`ATCO`) to retrieve journal numbers (`ACARJ#`, `ACSLJ#`). If found (`N91`), sets `AR#` and `SL#`; if `SJ##` is non-zero, uses it for `SL#`.
     - Clears indicators `05`, `06`.

2. **Main Processing Loop**:
   - Processes `ARTRAN` records sequentially, controlled by level breaks (`L1`, `L2`, `L3`):
     - **L3 (Company Change)**: Resets accumulators and retrieves journal numbers.
     - **L2 (Inter-Company Change)**: Checks if `ATICCD = 'IC'` (indicator `92` for inter-company customers).
     - **L1 (Transaction Type Change)**: Resets transaction accumulators (`NETCHG`, `INVAMT`, `ADJAMT`, `TOTREC`, `TOTMIS`, `TOTINV`) and clears indicators `71`, `72`, `73`.
   - Executes one-time setup (`ONETIM`) if not already done (`N90`).

3. **One-Time Setup (`ONETIM`)**:
   - Captures system time (`TIMEOF`) and date (`TIMDAT`).
   - Converts journal date (`JRNLDT`) to YMD format (`JYMD`) with Y2K compliance:
     - If `JYR >= Y2KCMP (80)`, uses `Y2KCEN (19)`; otherwise, increments `Y2KCEN` by 1.
     - Builds 8-digit date (`JRNLD8`) in CCYYMMDD format.
   - Converts system date to YMD (`SYSDT8`) for reporting.
   - Sets indicator `90` to mark setup completion.

4. **Transaction Type Determination (`TRNSID`)**:
   - Clears indicators for transaction types (`10`, `20`, `30`, `40`, `50`, `31`, `32`, `37`, `15`, `81`, `12`).
   - Converts transaction date (`ATDATE`) and due date (`ATDUDT`) to YMD format (`ATDAT8`, `ATDUD8`) with Y2K compliance.
   - Compares invoice date to journal date if `LDRETL = 'R'` (sets indicator `65` if different).
   - Identifies transaction type:
     - `ATCOD = 'Y'` sets indicator `25` (COD invoice).
     - `ATTYPE = 'I'` sets `10` (invoice).
     - `ATTYPE = 'J'` sets `20` (adjustment).
     - `ATTYPE = 'P'` sets `30` (payment).
   - Sets journal type (`JRNTYP`): `SJ` for invoices/adjustments, `CR` for payments.
   - For COD invoices (`25`), skips further processing (`GOTO ENDTR`).

5. **Transaction Processing**:
   - **Invoice (`10`)**:
     - If miscellaneous billing (`16` and `86`), sets indicators `15`, `17`, clears `10`.
     - If not already an adjustment (`N12`), executes `INVSUM`.
     - If an adjustment (`12`), executes `ADJUST`.
   - **Adjustment (`20`)**:
     - Executes `ADJUST`.
   - **Payment (`30`)**:
     - If not miscellaneous (`N80`), executes `PAYMNT`.
     - If miscellaneous (`80`), executes `MISC$$`.
   - **Inter-Company Check**:
     - If `ATICCD = 'IC'` (`92`), skips updates to `ARCUST`, `ARDETL`, `ARHIST` (only generates journal entries).
   - Checks `ARDETL` for existing invoice (`KEY18 = ATCOCU + ATINV# + 'I00'`):
     - If found (`39`) and payment (`30` or `20`), executes `PPDADD` and loops back (`GOTO AGNX`).
     - If not found or invoice (`10`), proceeds to `UNIQUE`.
   - Sets adjustment flag (`12`) if invoice starts with `9` (`ATINV1 = '9'`, indicator `31`).

6. **Invoice Summary (`INVSUM`)**:
   - Increments invoice count (`TOTINV`).
   - Adds transaction amount (`ATAMT`) to `INVAMT`.
   - Chains to `ARCUST` by `ATCOCU`:
     - If found (`N99`), updates aged balance (`AGE,P`), total due (`ARTOTD`), month-to-date (`ARMTD$`), year-to-date (`ARYTD$`).
     - Sets indicator `40` for customer update.
   - Writes to `ARDETL` and `ARHIST` (see output specs).

7. **Prepaid Invoice Add (`PPDADD`)**:
   - Creates an empty invoice record for prepaid transactions (indicator `61`).
   - Writes to `ARDETL` and `ARHIST` with zero amounts.

8. **Adjustment Processing (`ADJUST`)**:
   - Chains to `ARCUST` by `ATCOCU`:
     - If not found or exists (`N39`, `N99`), sets indicators `40`, `50`.
     - Updates `AGE,P`, `ARTOTD`, `ARMTD$`, `ARYTD$`.
   - Updates `ARDETL`:
     - Subtracts `ATAMT` from current month paid (`ADPAY`).
     - Increments next sequence number (`ADNEXT`).
     - Adds sales amount (`ATDSAL` to `ADDSAL`).
     - Updates notification of difference (`ADNOD`) and reference invoice (`ADRFIV`) if blank/zero.
   - Writes to `ARDETL` and `ARHIST` (indicator `60`).
   - Increments `TOTINV`, adds `ATAMT` to `ADJAMT`.

9. **Payment Processing (`PAYMNT`)**:
   - Chains to `ARCUST` by `ATCOCU`:
     - If not found or exists (`N39`, `N99`), updates `AGE,P`, `ARTOTD`, month-to-date paid (`ARM$PD`), year-to-date paid (`ARY$PD`), payment amount (`ARPYMT`), payment date (`ARPDAT`, `ARPDA8`).
   - Updates `ARDETL`:
     - Increments `ADNEXT`, adds `ATAMT` to `ADPAY`, updates `ADNOD`, `ADRFIV`.
   - Writes to `ARDETL` and `ARHIST` (indicator `60`).
   - Increments `TOTINV`, accumulates totals:
     - `TOTREC` (received), `TOTDIS` (discount), `ATCASH` (net cash = `ATAMT - ATDISC`), `TOTCAS` (total cash), `TOTARC` (A/R cash).
   - Compares `ATAMT` to remaining balance (`ARLEFT`, sets `32`, `37`).

10. **Miscellaneous Cash (`MISC$$`)**:
    - If finance charge (`ATDSFC = 'FIN CHG'`), chains to `ARCUST` and subtracts `ATAMT` from finance charges (`ARFIN$`).
    - Adds `ATAMT` to `TOTCAS` (total cash) and `TOTMIS` (miscellaneous cash).
    - Sets `ATCASH` to `ATAMT`.

11. **Final Totals (`FINTOT`)**:
    - Calculates net change to A/R (`NETCHG = INVAMT + ADJAMT - TOTREC`).
    - Writes final totals to `REPORT` and `REPORTP`.

12. **Output Operations**:
    - **ARDIST**: Writes journal entries for invoices (`I`), adjustments (`J`), payments (`P`), COD invoices (`I`), including customer, amount, G/L accounts, and dates.
    - **ARTRAN**: Marks processed transactions with `P` (position 54).
    - **ARCUST**: Updates customer balances, payment info, and aged amounts (indicator `40`).
    - **ARDETL**: Adds/updates invoice, adjustment, payment, or prepaid records.
    - **ARHIST**: Logs transaction history for invoices, adjustments, payments, and prepaids.
    - **ARCONT**: Updates journal numbers (`ACARJ#`, `ACSLJ#`) at company level break (L3).
    - **REPORT/REPORTP**: Prints posting register with headers, invoice, adjustment, payment details, and totals.

### Business Rules

1. **Transaction Types**:
   - **Invoices (`ATTYPE = 'I'`)**: Update customer balances, A/R details, and history; generate sales journal (`SJ`) entries.
   - **Adjustments (`ATTYPE = 'J'`)**: Adjust customer balances and A/R details; generate `SJ` entries.
   - **Payments (`ATTYPE = 'P'`)**: Reduce customer balances, update payment info, and generate cash receipts (`CR`) entries.
   - **COD Invoices (`ATCOD = 'Y'`)**: Skip standard processing, generate journal entries only.
   - **Miscellaneous Cash (`80`)**: If finance charge (`FIN CHG`), reduce `ARFIN$`; otherwise, record as miscellaneous cash.

2. **Inter-Company Customers (`ATICCD = 'IC'`)**:
   - Do not update `ARCUST`, `ARDETL`, or `ARHIST`; only generate journal entries in `ARDIST`.

3. **Date Handling**:
   - Converts transaction and due dates to YMD format (CCYYMMDD) with Y2K compliance (`Y2KCEN`, `Y2KCMP`).
   - Compares invoice date to journal date if `LDRETL = 'R'` to flag discrepancies (indicator `65`).

4. **Journal Numbers**:
   - Increments `ACSLJ#` for invoices/adjustments (`10` or `20`, indicator `05`) if `SJ##` is zero.
   - Increments `ACARJ#` for payments (`30`, indicator `06`).
   - Updates `ARCONT` with new journal numbers at company level break.

5. **Customer Updates**:
   - Updates `ARCUST` for non-inter-company transactions: aged balances (`AGE`), total due (`ARTOTD`), payment info (`ARPYMT`, `ARPDAT`), and period totals (`ARMTD$`, `ARYTD$`, `ARM$PD`, `ARY$PD`).
   - Reduces finance charges (`ARFIN$`) for miscellaneous cash payments.

6. **A/R Detail Updates**:
   - Adds new records for invoices, adjustments, payments, or prepaids.
   - Updates existing records with payments (`ADPAY`), sequence numbers (`ADNEXT`), sales amounts (`ADDSAL`), notification of difference (`ADNOD`), and reference invoice (`ADRFIV`).

7. **History Logging**:
   - Records all transactions (except inter-company) in `ARHIST` with details like company, customer, invoice, amount, and dates.

8. **Reporting**:
   - Produces two copies of the posting register (`REPORT`, `REPORTP`) with sections for invoices, adjustments, and payments, including totals for A/R applied, discounts, cash, and net change.
   - Includes headers with company name, date, time, user ID, workstation ID, and journal date.

9. **Prepaid Invoices**:
   - Creates empty invoice records in `ARDETL` and `ARHIST` for prepaid transactions with zero amounts.

10. **Error Handling**:
    - Chains to `ARCUST` and `ARDETL` to validate customer and invoice existence.
    - Uses indicators (`39`, `99`, `50`) to handle missing or existing records.

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files (tables):
1. **Input Files**:
   - `ARTRAN` (F-spec 0014): Transaction file (256 bytes, update mode), sorted input from `?9?AR201S`.
   - `ARDETL` (0015): A/R detail file (128 bytes, update mode, keyed by company/customer/invoice, shared access).
   - `ARCUST` (0016): Customer master file (384 bytes, update mode, keyed by company/customer, shared access).
   - `ARCONT` (0017): A/R control file (256 bytes, update mode, keyed by company, shared access).

2. **Output Files**:
   - `ARHIST` (0018): A/R history file (128 bytes, output mode).
   - `ARDIST` (0019): Distribution file (161 bytes, output mode) for journal entries.
   - `REPORT` (0020): Primary transaction posting register (164 bytes, printer file).
   - `REPORTP` (0021): Pittsburgh copy of the register (164 bytes, printer file).

3. **Compile-Time Data**:
   - `MN`: Month names array (January–December) for report formatting.

### External Programs Called

The program **does not explicitly call external programs** using `CALL` operations. All processing is handled internally via subroutines:
- `ONETIM`: One-time setup for dates and system info.
- `TRNSID`: Determines transaction type and converts dates.
- `INVSUM`: Processes invoice summaries.
- `PPDADD`: Adds prepaid invoice records.
- `ADJUST`: Processes adjustments.
- `PAYMNT`: Processes payments.
- `MISC$$`: Handles miscellaneous cash.
- `FINTOT`: Calculates final totals.

### Notes
- **Y2K Compliance**: Uses `Y2KCEN` (19) and `Y2KCMP` (80) to handle century in dates, ensuring CCYYMMDD format.
- **Inter-Company Logic**: Explicitly skips A/R updates for `ATICCD = 'IC'`, focusing on journal entries.
- **Modifications**:
  - 4/20/05: Enhanced description field handling for cash receipts in `TEMGEN`.
  - 8/06/14: Changed printer names for paperless reporting, removed W. Conshohocken copy.
- **Journal Types**: `SJ` (sales journal) for invoices/adjustments, `CR` (cash receipts) for payments.
- **File Access**: Shared access (`DISP-SHR`) for `ARDETL`, `ARCUST`, `ARCONT` allows concurrent processing.
