The provided document is an RPG/36 program, `AR300.rpg36.txt`, called from the OCL program `AR300P.ocl36.txt`. This program generates monthly accounts receivable (A/R) statements and prepares the `ARDETL` file for purging. It processes customer and transaction data, calculates finance charges, and produces multiple output reports with different formats. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AR300 RPG/36 Program

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Header Specifications**:
     - `H P064`: Program identifier for `AR300`.
   - **File Declarations**:
     - `ARDETL UP F 128 128R I DISK`: Accounts receivable detail file, update mode, 128-byte records, indexed.
     - `AR300S IR F 30 3 3IT EDISK`: Input file for statement parameters, 30-byte records, indexed, externally described.
     - `ARCUST UC 384 384R 8AI 2 DISK`: Customer master file, update mode, 384-byte records, keyed on company/customer number.
     - `ARCONT IC F 256 256R 2AI 2 DISK`: A/R control file, input mode, 256-byte records, keyed on company number.
     - `BICONT IC F 256 256R 2AI 2 DISK`: Billing control file, input mode, 256-byte records, keyed on company number.
     - `REPORT O 132 132 OF LPRINTER`: Primary statement output file, 132 characters, overflow indicator `OF`.
     - `REPRT2 O 132 132 OV LPRINTER`: Remittance stub output, overflow indicator `OV`.
     - `REPRT3 O 132 132 OA LPRINTER`: Statement copy for saving (e.g., to `PITT-FS/SHARED/AR STATEMENTS`), overflow indicator `OA`.
     - `REPRT4 O 132 132 OB LPRINTER`: Alternate statement format, overflow indicator `OB`.
     - `REPRT5 O 132 132 OC LPRINTER`: Wire transfer statement format, overflow indicator `OC`.
   - **Arrays and Data Structures**:
     - `AGE`: Array of 5 elements (9 digits, 2 decimals) for aging buckets (current, 01-10, 11-20, 21-30, over 30 days).
     - `MSG`: Array of 15 elements (70 characters) for auditor’s messages (e.g., “PLEASE EXAMINE THIS STATEMENT CAREFULLY”).
     - `UDS`: Data structure for job parameters:
       - `KYALCO` (ALL/CO), `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3` (company numbers), `KYJOBQ` (job queue), `KYCOPY` (number of copies), `KYDATE` (statement date), `STMO`, `STDAY`, `STYR`, `DATE4` (date fields).
   - **Line Counter Specifications**:
     - `LREPORT`, `LREPRT2`, `LREPRT3`, `LREPRT4`, `LREPRT5`: Define 66 lines per page, 61 lines before overflow.

2. **One-Time Initialization (`ONETIM` Subroutine)**:
   - Sets indicator `98` on to mark completion.
   - Initializes `ZERO9` (9-digit, 0 decimals) to 0 for use in output calculations.
   - Executed only if indicator `98` is off (`N98`).

3. **Company Loop (Level Break `L2`)**:
   - **Control File Access**:
     - Chains to `ARCONT` using `ADCO` (company number from `ARDETL`).
     - If not found (`95` on), skips further processing for the company.
     - Calculates `LFMO` (last fiscal month) by subtracting 1 from `ACFFMO` (first fiscal month). If `LFMO <= 0`, sets `LFMO = 12`.
     - Compares `STMO` (statement month) with `LFMO`. If equal, sets `92` (last fiscal month indicator).
     - Chains to `BICONT` using `ADCO`. If not found (`97` on), sets `64` (default invoicing style).
     - Checks `BCINST` (invoicing style) in `BICONT`:
       - `1`: Sets `61` (style 1).
       - `2`: Sets `62` (style 2).
       - `5`: Sets `63` (style 5, likely wire transfer format).
       - Other: Sets `64` (default format).
   - **Loop Control**:
     - Continues processing for each company (`DO` at `L2`).

4. **Customer Processing (`ARCUST` Subroutine)**:
   - Chains to `ARCUST` using `ADCOCU` (company/customer number from `ARDETL`).
   - If not found (`20` on), sets `ARFIN$` (finance charge) to 0.
   - Resets `PAGE` to 0 and indicators `10` (print statement) and `82` (finance charge calculation).
   - Checks if statements are required (`ARSTMT ≠ 'N'` and indicator `11` on) to set `10`.
   - Checks if wire transfer is used (`ARWIRE = 'Y'`) to set `49`.
   - Validates total due (`ARTOTD`) against sum of aging buckets (`XFOOT AGE`). If unequal, sets `40`.
   - Calculates finance charge balance (`FCBAL`) by summing `AR0110`, `AR1120`, `AR2130`, `AROV30`.
   - Sets previous balance (`ARPBAL = ARTOTD`).

5. **Transaction Processing (`TRANS` Subroutine)**:
   - Resets indicators `39`, `44`, `73` (credit transaction).
   - Converts `ADDATE` (A/R date, YMD) to `ADMDY` (MDY) by multiplying by 100.0001.
   - Determines transaction type (`ADTYPE`):
     - `I`: Sets `35` (invoice).
     - `J`: Sets `37` (journal).
     - `P`: Sets `38` (payment).
   - Sets `44` (print transaction line).
   - If not an invoice (`N35`), skips to `NOINV`.
   - Calculates remaining amount (`ADLEFT = ADAMT - ADPART`).
   - Adds current month payment (`ADPAY`) to partial payment (`ADPART`).
   - Recalculates remaining amount (`LEFTAR = ADAMT - ADPART`). If equal, sets `41` (paid in full).
   - Checks if `PPINV#` (partial payment invoice) is 9 to set `15` (miscellaneous cash).
   - Checks `ADAGE` (aging code) for 1 to set `13` (past due invoice).

6. **Finance Charge Calculation (`L1CALC` Subroutine)**:
   - Resets indicators `80`, `83`, `85`.
   - If finance charges apply (`ARFINC = 'Y'`), sets `80`.
   - Calculates finance charge (`FCAMT = FCBAL * ACFINC`). If `FCAMT > 0`, sets `83`.
   - If `FCAMT < 0.50`, sets `FCAMT = 0.50` and `85`.
   - Adds `FCAMT` to `ARFIN$` and current due (`CURPRT = ARCURD + FCAMT`).
   - Moves aging amounts to print fields: `AR0110` to `X10PRT`, `AR1120` to `X11PRT`, `AR2130` to `X21PRT`, `AROV30` to `X31PRT`, `ARTOTD` to `TOTPRT`.

7. **Output Processing**:
   - **Detail Records (`ARDETL`)**:
     - For non-invoice transactions (`N35`), writes `P` (payment) at position 48.
     - For invoices (`35`), writes `ADAMT`, `ADPART`, `ZERO9`, and `P` (paid, if `41`) or `S` (statement, if `N41`) at position 48.
   - **Customer Totals (`ARCUST`)**:
     - At level break `L1`, if `40` (total mismatch) or `80` (finance charge), writes `ARFIN$` and `ARPBAL`.
   - **REPORT (Primary Statement)**:
     - Prints headers (company address, date, customer info) and transaction details.
     - Includes aging totals, finance charges, and “CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE” if overflow (`OF`).
   - **REPRT2 (Remittance Stub)**:
     - Prints remittance details (e.g., “REMIT TO: COMM*PLAN DIVISION”).
   - **REPRT3 (Saved Copy)**:
     - Similar to `REPORT` but includes wire transfer details if `63` is on (e.g., PNC Bank info).
     - Added 6/21/13 for saving to `PITT-FS/SHARED/AR STATEMENTS`.
   - **REPRT4 (Alternate Format)**:
     - Prints minimal remittance info, used if `64` (default style).
   - **REPRT5 (Wire Transfer Format)**:
     - Includes bank details (e.g., ABA# 031207607) for wire transfer customers (`63`).

### Business Rules
1. **Statement Generation**:
   - Statements are printed only if `ARSTMT ≠ 'N'` and total due is non-zero (`11` on).
   - Supports multiple companies (`KYALCO = 'ALL'` or specific `KYCO1`, `KYCO2`, `KYCO3`).
2. **Finance Charges**:
   - Applied if `ARFINC = 'Y'` in `ARCUST`.
   - Calculated as `FCBAL * ACFINC` (from `ARCONT`), with a minimum of $0.50.
   - Added to `ARFIN$` and current due (`ARCURD`).
3. **Aging Validation**:
   - Total due (`ARTOTD`) must equal sum of aging buckets (`ARCURD`, `AR0110`, `AR1120`, `AR2130`, `AROV30`).
4. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Supports invoices (`I`), journals (`J`), and payments (`P`).
   - Calculates remaining balance (`ADLEFT = ADAMT - ADPART`).
   - Flags paid-in-full invoices (`ADAMT = ADPART`).
   - Identifies miscellaneous cash payments (`PPINV# = 9`).
5. **Invoicing Styles**:
   - Determined by `BCINST` in `BICONT`:
     - `1`: Style 1 (`61`).
     - `2`: Style 2 (`62`).
     - `5`: Wire transfer format (`63`).
     - Other: Default format (`64`).
6. **Output Formats**:
   - Multiple reports (`REPORT`, `REPRT2`, `REPRT3`, `REPRT4`, `REPRT5`) for different purposes (primary, remittance, saved copy, wire transfer).
   - Includes auditor’s messages for verification.
7. **Purge Preparation**:
   - Updates `ARDETL` with payment status (`P` or `S`) to facilitate purging of paid records.

6. **REPORT, REPRT2, REPRT3, REPRT4, REPRT5**:
   - Printer files (132 characters) for statement outputs.

### External Programs Called
- **None**:
  - The program does not explicitly call external programs (e.g., via `CALL`).
  - It is invoked by the OCL program (`AR300P.ocl36.txt`) as the `AR300` procedure but does not call other programs itself.

### Additional Notes
- **Purpose**: Generates detailed A/R statements with customer, transaction, and aging information, and prepares `ARDETL` for purging by marking paid records.
- **Output Variants**: Multiple printer files support different statement formats, including a saved copy (`REPRT3`) and wire transfer details (`REPRT5`).
- **Integration with OCL**: Called as `AR300` in the OCL, using parameters like `?9?` for file labels and `KY` fields for input.
- **Modification**: Addition of `REPRT5` (6/21/13) for wire transfer format enhances functionality for specific customers.
