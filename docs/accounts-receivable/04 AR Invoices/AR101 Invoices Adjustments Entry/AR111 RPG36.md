The provided document, `AR111.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG II program for the IBM System/36 environment, called from the main OCL program (`AR101.ocl36.txt`) to edit and validate Accounts Receivable (A/R) transactions. It processes sorted transactions from the `AR111S` file, validates them against various master files, and produces a printed report detailing the results, including errors and totals. Below, I will explain the process steps, business rules, tables (files) used, and any external programs called.

### **Process Steps of the AR111 RPG Program**

The `AR111` program validates A/R transactions (invoices and adjustments) and generates a report to highlight valid transactions, errors, and totals. It operates in a batch mode, reading from the sorted transaction file `AR111S` and updating the `ARTRAN` file. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization (Level 2 - L2)**:
   - At the start of processing for each company (`ATCO`, Level 2 control break), the program:
     - Captures the current date and time using `TIME` and `MOVELTIMDAT` operations, storing them in `TIMDAT`, `TIME`, and `DATE`.
     - Resets the page number (`PAGE`) to zero.
     - Chains to the `ARCONT` file using `ATCO` to retrieve company details (e.g., `ACNAME`). If not found, sets indicator `99`.
   - Prints report headers, including company name, date, time, and column headings for the transaction edit report.

2. **Read and Process Transactions**:
   - Reads records from the sorted input file `AR111S` (300 bytes, 3-byte key).
   - For each transaction record in `ARTRAN` (matched with `AR111S` via `E AR111S ARTRAN`), performs validations and calculations.
   - If the record is marked as deleted (`ATDEL = 'D'`), it skips further processing.

3. **Validation Subroutines**:
   - **Customer Validation**:
     - Chains to `ARCUST` using the customer key (`ATCOCU`, company + customer number). If not found, sets indicator `21` and marks an error (`*in29`).
     - Compares salesman number (`ATSLS`) with the customer’s salesman (`ARSLS#`). If different, sets indicator `63`.
   - **Credit G/L Account Validation**:
     - If the credit G/L account (`ATGLCR`) is non-zero, constructs a G/L key (`ATGL`) using the credit company (`ATCOCR`) and account number.
     - Calls the `GETGL` subroutine to validate against `GLMAST`. If the account is not found, deleted (`GLDEL = 'D'`), or inactive (`GLDEL = 'I'`), sets indicator `22` and marks an error (`*in29`).
     - Compares `ATGLCR` with the sales G/L account (`ACSLGL`) from `ARCONT`. If equal, sets indicator `60`.
   - **Debit G/L Account Validation**:
     - If the debit G/L account (`ATGLDR`) is non-zero, constructs a G/L key using the debit company (`ATCODR`) and account number.
     - Calls `GETGL` to validate against `GLMAST`. If not found, deleted, or inactive, sets indicator `22` and marks an error (`*in29`).
     - Compares `ATGLDR` with the A/R G/L account (`ACARGL`) from `ARCONT`. If equal, sets indicator `61`.
   - **Terms Code Validation**:
     - If the terms code (`ATTERM`) is non-zero, constructs a key (`TRMKEY`) using `'ARTERM'` and the terms code.
     - Chains to `GSTABL`. If not found, sets indicator `26` and marks an error (`*in29`).
   - **Invoice/Adjustment Validation**:
     - Builds an A/R detail key (`KEY18`) using company, customer, invoice number (`ATINV#`), and type (`'I00'` for invoices).
     - Chains to `ARDETL`. If found, calculates the invoice date (`INVDAT`) and checks the transaction type:
       - For invoices (`ATTYPE = 'I'`), if the invoice exists and the amount is non-zero, sets indicators `27` and `29` (duplicate invoice error).
       - For adjustments (`ATTYPE = 'J'`), if the invoice does not exist, sets indicator `30` (invoice not found warning).
     - Validates transaction type. If not `I` or `J`, sets indicators `25` and `29` (invalid type error).
     - Checks if the transaction amount (`ATAMT`) is zero, setting indicator `73`.

4. **Transaction Processing**:
   - **Invoice Processing** (`ATTYPE = 'I'`):
     - If the transaction is an invoice and no errors exist (`*in27` off), processes it as valid.
     - If errors exist, skips to the `END` tag.
   - **Adjustment Processing** (`ATTYPE = 'J'`):
     - Validates that the type is `J`. If not `I` or `J`, sets error indicators `25` and `29` and skips to `END`.
   - Updates the `ARTRAN` file with an error flag (`'E'`) if any validation errors occur (`*in29`), otherwise clears the flag.

5. **Totals Calculation**:
   - For A/R detail records (`*in34` on):
     - Calculates prior month balance (`ADAMT - ADPART`).
     - Calculates current month balance (`ARLEFT = ADAMT - ADPAY`).
     - Adds `ARLEFT` to total invoices (`TOTINV`).
   - Adds transaction amount (`ATAMT`) to total A/R (`TOTAR`).
   - Accumulates net change to A/R (`NETCHG`) by adding `ATAMT`.

6. **Report Generation**:
   - Prints transaction details for each record, including:
     - Sequence number (`ATKEY`), customer number (`ATCUST`), customer name (`ARNAME`), invoice number (`ATINV#`), invoice amount (`ARLEFT`), invoice date (`INVDAT`), transaction amount (`ATAMT`), transaction date (`ATDATE`), type (`INVOICE`, `ADJUST`, or `CREDIT`), description (`ATDESC`), reference invoice (`ATRFIV`), G/L debit/credit accounts, terms, due date, and salesman.
   - Prints error messages for specific conditions:
     - Customer not found (`*in21`): "CUSTOMER REC. NOT FOUND".
     - G/L account not found/deleted/inactive (`*in22`): "GL ACCOUNT NOT FOUND".
     - Duplicate invoice (`*in27`): "DUPLICATE INVOICE".
     - Invoice not found for adjustment (`*in30`): "INVOICE REC. NOT FOUND".
     - Invalid transaction type (`*in25`): "INVALID TRANS TYPE".
     - Invalid terms code (`*in26`): "INVALID TERMS CODE".
   - At the end of processing (`LR` indicator), prints totals:
     - Total invoices (`TOTINV`) for invoices only (`*in33` off).
     - Total A/R transactions (`TOTAR`).
     - Net change to A/R (`NETCHG`).

7. **End of Processing**:
   - Updates the `ARTRAN` file with validated records, marking errors where applicable.
   - Closes files and terminates.

### **Business Rules**

The program enforces the following business rules for A/R transaction editing:

1. **Customer Validation**:
   - Customer number (`ATCUST`) combined with company (`ATCO`) must exist in `ARCUST`. If not, an error is reported.
   - Salesman number (`ATSLS`) is compared with the customer’s salesman (`ARSLS#`) for consistency.

2. **G/L Account Validation**:
   - Credit G/L account (`ATGLCR`) and debit G/L account (`ATGLDR`) must exist in `GLMAST` and not be deleted (`GLDEL = 'D'`) or inactive (`GLDEL = 'I'`). Invalid accounts trigger an error.
   - Credit account is compared with the sales G/L account (`ACSLGL`), and debit account with the A/R G/L account (`ACARGL`) for default validation.

3. **Terms Code Validation**:
   - Terms code (`ATTERM`) must exist in `GSTABL` under the `ARTERM` key. Invalid terms trigger an error.

4. **Transaction Type**:
   - Transaction type (`ATTYPE`) must be `I` (invoice) or `J` (adjustment). Invalid types trigger an error.
   - Invoices require a non-zero amount (`ATAMT`).

5. **Invoice Validation**:
   - For invoices (`I`), the invoice must not already exist in `ARDETL` (duplicate check). If it exists and the amount is non-zero, an error is reported.
   - For adjustments (`J`), the referenced invoice must exist in `ARDETL`. If not, a warning is issued.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors (e.g., invalid customer, G/L account, terms, or duplicate invoice) set indicator `29`, mark the `ARTRAN` record with `'E'`, and print an error message.
   - Warnings (e.g., invoice not found for adjustments) are printed but do not mark the record as an error.

7. **Totals**:
   - Tracks total invoices (`TOTINV`), total A/R transactions (`TOTAR`), and net change to A/R (`NETCHG`).
   - Prior and current month balances are calculated for A/R detail records.

8. **Reporting**:
   - Produces a detailed report with headers, transaction details, errors/warnings, and final totals.
   - Errors and warnings are clearly marked with `****` and descriptive messages.

### **External Programs Called**

The `AR111` RPG program does not explicitly call any external programs. All processing is handled within the program, primarily through the `GETGL` subroutine for G/L account validation.

---

### **Summary**

The `AR111` RPG program, called from the main OCL program, validates sorted A/R transactions from `AR111S`, ensuring compliance with business rules for customers, G/L accounts, terms, and invoice/adjustment data. It updates the `ARTRAN` file with error flags for invalid records and produces a detailed printed report listing transactions, errors, warnings, and totals. The program uses eight files (`AR111S`, `ARTRAN`, `ARCUST`, `ARDETL`, `GLMAST`, `ARCONT`, `GSTABL`, `PRINT`) and relies on the `GETGL` subroutine for G/L validation. No external programs are called, and the program enforces strict validation to maintain A/R data integrity.
