The provided document is an RPGLE (RPG IV) program, `AR300P.rpgle.txt`, which is called from the OCL program `AR300P.ocl36.txt`. This RPG program is designed to prompt users for input parameters to generate monthly statements for accounts receivable (AR). It validates user input, checks data against files, and displays error messages if validation fails. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables/files used, and any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the AR300P RPGLE Program

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Header Specifications**:
     - `H DFTACTGRP(*NO)`: Runs in a named activation group (not the default), allowing better control over resources.
     - `H DFTNAME(AR300P)`: Specifies the default program name as `AR300P`.
     - `H FIXNBR(*ZONED:*INPUTPACKED)`: Handles numeric fields with zoned or packed decimal formats during conversion.
   - **File Declarations**:
     - `AR300PD CF E WORKSTN`: Defines a workstation file (`AR300PD`) for interactive screen input/output, using Profound UI (`Handler('PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)')`) for the user interface.
     - `ARCONT IF F 256 2AIDISK KEYLOC(2)`: Defines an input file (`ARCONT`) with a record length of 256 bytes, keyed on position 2 (company number, `acco`), used for accounts receivable control data.
     - `GSCONT IF F 512 2AIDISK KEYLOC(2)`: Defines another input file (`GSCONT`) with a record length of 512 bytes, also keyed on position 2 (company number, `gxcono`), likely for global system control data.
   - **Data Structures and Variables**:
     - `dco`: A 35-character array (10 elements) to store company numbers and names.
     - `com`: A 40-character array (7 elements) initialized with compile-time data (`CTDATA`) for error messages (e.g., "INVALID STATEMENT DATE").
     - `uds`: A data structure for job parameters, including:
       - `kyalco` (ALL/CO selection), `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3` (company numbers), `kydate` (statement date), `kycmtd` (month-to-date flag), `kycytd` (year-to-date flag), `kycopy` (number of copies), `y2kcen` (Y2K century), `y2kcmp` (Y2K comparison year).
   - **Indicators**: Used extensively for controlling program flow and screen output (e.g., `*IN01`, `*IN09`, `*IN81`, `*IN90`).

2. **Main Processing Logic**:
   - **Workstation File Read**:
     - Checks `qsctl` (a control field, likely from the screen or job).
     - If `qsctl` is blank, sets `*IN09` (initial screen display) and `qsctl` to 'R', then proceeds.
     - Otherwise, sets `*IN01` (process input), reads the screen file (`AR300PD`), and returns if the last record indicator (`LR`) is set.
   - **Indicator Setup**:
     - Resets indicators (`*IN20`, `*IN81`, `*IN90`, `*IN30`–`*IN37`) to ensure a clean state.
     - Clears the `msg` field (40 characters) for error messages.
   - **F3 Key Handling**:
     - If `*INKG` (F3 key) is pressed, sets `*INU1` and `*INLR` (program termination), clears `*IN01` and `*IN09`, and jumps to the `end` tag to exit.
   - **Initial Screen Display**:
     - If `*IN09` is on, sets `*IN81` (write screen) and executes the `onetim` subroutine for one-time initialization.
   - **Input Processing**:
     - If `*IN01` is on, executes the `edit` subroutine to validate user input.
   - **Screen Output**:
     - If `*IN81` is off, sets `*INLR` to terminate the program.
     - Writes to the `AR300PD` screen file if `*IN81` is on, displaying the input prompt or error messages.

3. **Edit Subroutine (`edit`)**:
   - **Security Code Validation**:
     - Chains to `ARCONT` using key `01` (company number).
     - Compares `kysec` (input security code) with `acsecr` (security code in `ARCONT`).
     - If mismatched, sets `*IN30`, `*IN81`, `*IN90`, and displays error message `com(7)` ("INVALID SECURITY CODE").
   - **Date Validation**:
     - Moves `kydate` to `mmddyy` and calls `@dtedt` to validate the date.
     - If `*IN79` (date error) is set, displays `com(1)` ("INVALID STATEMENT DATE") and sets `*IN31`, `*IN81`, `*IN90`.
   - **ALL/CO Selection Validation**:
     - Checks if `kyalco` is 'ALL' or 'CO '.
     - If `kyalco` is 'ALL' or 'CO ', validates further:
       - If `kyalco` is neither 'ALL' nor 'CO', displays `com(2)` ("ENTER ALL OR CO") and sets `*IN32`, `*IN81`, `*IN90`.
   - **Company Number Validation**:
     - If `kyalco` is 'CO', checks `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3`:
       - If all are zero, displays `com(3)` ("IF CO, THEN ENTER VALID COMPANIES") and sets `*IN32`, `*IN81`, `*IN90`.
       - If `kyalco` is 'ALL' and any company numbers are non-zero, displays `com(4)` ("IF ALL, THEN DO NOT ENTER COMPANIES") and sets `*IN32`, `*IN81`, `*IN90`.
     - For each non-zero `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3`:
       - Positions the `ARCONT` file using `SETLL`.
       - Reads the record and checks if it’s deleted (`acdel = 'D'`) or if the company number (`acco`) matches.
       - If no valid record is found, displays `com(5)` ("INVALID COMPANY NUMBER") and sets `*IN33`, `*IN34`, or `*IN35` (for `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3`) plus `*IN81`, `*IN90`.
   - **Month-to-Date/Year-to-Date Flags**:
     - Validates `kycmtd` and `kycytd` (must be 'Y', 'N', or blank).
     - If invalid, displays `com(6)` ("INVALID PARAMETER") and sets `*IN81`, `*IN90`.
   - **Number of Copies**:
     - If `kycopy` is zero, sets it to 1.
   - **Final Setup**:
     - Sets `*IN11` to indicate successful validation.

4. **One-Time Subroutine (`onetim`)**:
   - **Initialize Company Array**:
     - Clears the `dco` array and sets index `x` to 1.
     - Positions `ARCONT` at the beginning (`aclim = 00`).
     - Reads `ARCONT` records, skipping deleted records (`acdel = 'D'`).
     - Stores company number (`acco`) and name (`acname`) in `dco(x)` until 10 companies are loaded or end of file is reached.
     - Moves `dco` elements to individual fields (`DCO1`–`DCO10`) for screen display.
   - **Default Parameters**:
     - Chains to `GSCONT` with key `00`.
     - If a record is found and `gxcono` is non-zero, sets `kyalco` to 'CO ' and `kyco1` to `gxcono`.
     - Otherwise, sets `kyalco` to 'ALL'.
     - Sets defaults: `kycmtd = 'Y'`, `kycytd = 'N'`, `kycopy = 01`, `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3 = 0`.
     - Sets `*IN10` to indicate completion.

5. **Date Edit Subroutine (`@dtedt`)**:
   - Validates the input date (`mmddyy`):
     - Breaks down into month (`$month`), day (`$day`), and year (`$yr`).
     - Checks if month is valid (1–12).
     - For February, validates days (28 or 29 for leap years) using century (`y2kcen`) and year calculations.
     - For other months, checks days (30 or 31 based on month).
     - Sets `*IN79` if any validation fails.

6. **Output Specifications**:
   - Writes to `AR300PD` if `*IN81` is on, outputting fields like `kysec`, `kydate`, `kyalco`, `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3`, `dco`, `kycmtd`, `kycytd`, `kycopy`, and `msg`.

### Business Rules
1. **Security Code**:
   - The input security code (`kysec`) must match the security code (`acsecr`) in the `ARCONT` file for the company.
2. **Statement Date**:
   - The date (`kydate`) must be valid (checked via `@dtedt` for month, day, and leap year).
3. **ALL/CO Selection**:
   - `kyalco` must be 'ALL' (process all companies) or 'CO ' (specific companies).
   - If 'CO ', at least one of `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3` must be non-zero.
   - If 'ALL', `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3` must be zero.
4. **Company Numbers**:
   - Each non-zero `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3` must exist in `ARCONT`, not be deleted (`acdel ≠ 'D'`), and match the company number (`acco`).
5. **Month-to-Date/Year-to-Date**:
   - `kycmtd` and `kycytd` must be 'Y', 'N', or blank.
6. **Number of Copies**:
   - `kycopy` defaults to 1 if zero.
7. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays specific error messages (`com(1)`–`com(7)`) for validation failures.
   - Returns to the screen for correction if errors occur.
8. **Initialization**:
   - Defaults are set based on `GSCONT` (company number or 'ALL') and hardcoded values (`kycmtd`, `kycytd`, `kycopy`).
   - Up to 10 companies are loaded for display.

### Tables/Files Used
1. **AR300PD**:
   - Workstation file (display file) for user interaction via Profound UI.
   - Contains fields like `kysec`, `kydate`, `kyalco`, `kyco1`, `kyco2`, `kyco3`, `dco`, `kycmtd`, `kycytd`, `kycopy`, `msg`.
2. **ARCONT**:
   - Accounts receivable control file (256 bytes, keyed on company number at position 2).
   - Fields:
     - `acdel` (1): Delete flag ('D' for deleted).
     - `acco` (2–3): Company number.
     - `acname` (4–33): Company name.
     - `acsecr` (84–91): Security code for statements.
3. **GSCONT**:
   - Global system control file (512 bytes, keyed on company number at position 2).
   - Fields:
     - `gxdel` (1): Delete flag.
     - `gxcono` (77–78): Company number.

### External Programs Called
- **None**:
  - The RPG program does not explicitly call external programs (e.g., via `CALL` or `QCMDEXC`).
  - It interacts with the Profound UI handler (`PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)`) for screen processing, but this is a runtime environment, not a program call.
  - The OCL program (`AR300P.ocl36.txt`) calls `AR300P`, but within `AR300P.rpgle`, no further programs are invoked.

### Additional Notes
- **Conversion Context**: The program was converted on 04/07/23 using TARGET/400, with 161 lines added, 5 modified, and 297 processed. Prefixes (`T4A`, `T4M`, `T4O`) indicate added, modified, or original lines.
- **Y2K Handling**: The `@dtedt` subroutine and fields like `y2kcen`, `y2kcmp` address Year 2000 date issues, ensuring correct leap year calculations.
- **Profound UI**: The use of `Handler('PROFOUNDUI(HANDLER)')` indicates a modernized user interface, likely a web-based front-end for the AS/400.
- **Error Messages**: The `com` array provides clear, user-friendly error messages, enhancing usability.
- **Integration with OCL**: The OCL program loads `AR300P` and provides the `ARCONT` file with a dynamic label (`?9?ARCONT`). The RPG program uses this file for validation.
