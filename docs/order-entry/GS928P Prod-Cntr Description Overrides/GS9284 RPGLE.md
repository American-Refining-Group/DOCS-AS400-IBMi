### Process Steps of the RPG Program (GS9284)

The program **GS9284** is an interactive RPG III program designed to handle the InActivate or ReActivate operations for Product/Container entries on an IBM i (AS/400) system. It is called from another program (e.g., GS928P, as referenced in the query) and operates on a single Product/Container record identified by input parameters (company, product, container). The program displays a window (ACTWDW) to confirm the InActivate or ReActivate action, updates the GSPRCT file accordingly, and returns a status flag to the caller. It uses a simple user interface with no subfile, focusing solely on toggling the `ptdel` field between 'A' (active) and 'I' (inactive).

The high-level process flow is as follows:

1. **Initialization (*INZSR Subroutine)**:
   - Receives entry parameters: `p$co` (company), `p$prod` (product code), `p$cntr` (container code), `p$fgrp` (file group: 'G' or 'Z' for file overrides), and `p$flag` (output flag to indicate action: 'I' for InActivate, 'A' for ReActivate).
   - Moves input parameters to display fields (`f$co`, `f$prod`, `f$cntr`).
   - Sets up work fields, key lists (for chaining to GSPRCT), and message handling fields.
   - Initializes the window loop flag (`winagn` = *ON) and message queue fields.
   - Defines constants for function keys: F12 (exit), F22 (ReActivate), F23 (InActivate).
   - Prepares date validation parameters (though unused in this code).

2. **Open Database Tables (OPNTBL Subroutine)**:
   - Applies file overrides using QCMDEXC based on `p$fgrp` (e.g., overrides to GSPRCT as GGS* for 'G' or ZGS* for 'Z').
   - Opens the GSPRCT file (update/add mode with USROPN).

3. **Retrieve Data (RTVDTA Subroutine)**:
   - Chains to GSPRCT using the passed keys (`f$co`, `f$prod`, `f$cntr`).
   - If the record is found (*IN99=*OFF):
     - If `ptdel` = 'I' (inactive), sets the window header to "Product/Cntr Entry ReActivate" (`hdr(01)`), function key label to "F22=ReActivate" (`fky(01)`), and enables F22 (*IN72=*ON).
     - Otherwise (active), sets the window header to "Product/Cntr Entry InActivate" (`hdr(02)`), function key label to "F23=InActivate" (`fky(02)`), and enables F23 (*IN73=*ON).
   - No action if the record is not found (no error message; proceeds to display window).

4. **Process Window (PRCWDW Subroutine - Main Processing Loop)**:
   - Enters a loop controlled by `winagn`:
     - Displays the message subfile if errors/messages exist (WRTMSG subroutine); otherwise, clears it (MSGCLR).
     - Displays the window format (EXFMT ACTWDW).
     - Clears the message subfile if displayed (CLRMSG subroutine).
     - Clears error indicators (*IN50-*IN69).
     - Processes user input:
       - **F12**: Exits the loop (`winagn` = *OFF), effectively canceling the operation.
       - **F22 or F23**: 
         - Calls WINEDT (which invokes CHKACT, though CHKACT is empty/no-op).
         - If no errors (*IN50=*OFF), updates the database (WINUPD subroutine) and exits the loop.
       - **Other (e.g., ENTER)**: Calls WINEDT (no-op since CHKACT is empty), loops again.
   - Loops until F12 or a successful F22/F23 action.

5. **Edit Window Input (WINEDT and CHKACT Subroutines)**:
   - WINEDT calls CHKACT, but CHKACT is empty (no validation logic implemented).
   - No input fields are validated in the window; the program relies on the function key pressed (F22/F23).

6. **Update Database (WINUPD Subroutine)**:
   - Processes based on the function key:
     - **F22 (ReActivate)**:
       - Chains to GSPRCT.
       - If record found and `ptdel` = 'I', sets `ptdel` = 'A' (active), updates the record, and sets `p$flag` = 'A'.
       - No action if not found or not inactive.
     - **F23 (InActivate)**:
       - Chains to GSPRCT.
       - If record found and `ptdel` ≠ 'I', sets `ptdel` = 'I' (inactive), updates the record, and sets `p$flag` = 'I'.
       - No action if not found or already inactive.
   - No error messages are added if the chain fails or the status is inappropriate.

7. **Error and Message Handling**:
   - Uses ADDMSG to send messages to the program message queue (QMHSNDPM), though no messages are explicitly added in this code.
   - WRTMSG writes the message subfile; CLRMSG clears it (using QMHRMVPM).
   - No specific error handling (e.g., for invalid records or failed updates).

8. **Program End**:
   - Closes all files.
   - Sets *INLR = *ON and returns (with `p$flag` indicating 'A', 'I', or unchanged if no action).

The program is minimal, focusing solely on toggling the active/inactive status of a Product/Container record via a confirmation window. It assumes the calling program (e.g., GS928P) validates the record’s existence and appropriateness before calling.

### Business Rules

- **Purpose**:
  - Toggles the `ptdel` field in GSPRCT between 'A' (active) and 'I' (inactive) based on user action (F22 for ReActivate, F23 for InActivate).
  - Returns a flag (`p$flag`) to indicate the action taken: 'A' for ReActivate, 'I' for InActivate, or unchanged (blank) if no update occurs.

- **Validation Rules**:
  - No explicit input validation (CHKACT is empty; no checks on input fields or record state beyond `ptdel`).
  - For F22 (ReActivate): Only updates if the record exists and is currently inactive (`ptdel` = 'I').
  - For F23 (InActivate): Only updates if the record exists and is not already inactive (`ptdel` ≠ 'I').
  - No error messages for invalid scenarios (e.g., record not found or wrong status); simply skips the update.

- **Database Operations**:
  - Updates the `ptdel` field in GSPRCT; no other fields are modified.
  - No create or delete operations; only updates existing records.
  - Uses soft-delete logic (`ptdel` = 'I' for inactive, 'A' for active).

- **User Interface Rules**:
  - Displays a confirmation window (ACTWDW) with dynamic headers and function key labels:
    - If record is inactive: Shows "Product/Cntr Entry ReActivate" and enables F22.
    - If active: Shows "Product/Cntr Entry InActivate" and enables F23.
  - Function keys:
    - F12: Cancels and exits without changes.
    - F22: ReActivates the record (sets `ptdel` = 'A').
    - F23: InActivates the record (sets `ptdel` = 'I').
  - No cursor positioning logic (commented out).

- **General**:
  - File overrides ensure data separation ('G' vs. 'Z' groups, likely for different environments/companies).
  - Assumes the calling program provides valid keys and checks for record validity.
  - No auditing/timestamps (e.g., no user or date updates in the record).
  - Minimal error handling; relies on caller for feedback (e.g., GS928P adds confirmation messages like "has been InActivated").

### Tables (Files) Used

The program uses the following files, overridden based on `p$fgrp` (to GGS* for 'G' or ZGS* for 'Z'):

- **GS9284D**: Display file (CF - control format, E - external). Used for the confirmation window (ACTWDW) and message subfile.
- **GSPRCT**: Primary file (UF A - update full procedural with add, E - externally described, K - keyed). Used for chaining and updating the `ptdel` field.

All files are opened with USROPN and shared access controlled via overrides. No additional validation files (e.g., BICONT, GSPROD, GSCNTR1) are used, unlike GS928 or GS928P.

### External Programs Called

The program does not call any external RPG or custom programs. It only uses system utilities (via CALL):

- **QCMDEXC**: Executes override commands for file redirection (GSPRCT to GGS* or ZGS*).
- **QMHSNDPM**: Sends messages to the program message queue (though no messages are sent in this code).
- **QMHRMVPM**: Removes messages from the program message queue.

No additional programs (e.g., for prompting or validation) are called, making this a lightweight, focused utility for status toggling.
