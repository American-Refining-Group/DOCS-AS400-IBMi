The provided RPG program, `BI9412.rpg36.txt`, is an RPG III program for IBM System/36 or AS/400, invoked by the `BI941.ocl36` OCL program. Its purpose is to update the customer sales agreement work file (`BICUAGXX`) by clearing the salesman number field (setting it to `'00'`) for records used in a customer-focused report. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### **Process Steps of the BI9412 RPG Program**

The program is straightforward, reading records from the `BICUAGXX` file and updating the salesman number field to `'00'` to ensure proper sorting for a customer report. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **File and Data Structure Definitions** (Lines 0002–0010):
   - **Header (H) Specification**:
     - `064`: Likely a program option or parameter.
     - Program name: `BI9412`.
   - **File Specifications (F)**:
     - `BICUAGXX`: Update file (258 bytes, disk) containing customer sales agreement data.
   - **Input Specifications (I)**:
     - `BICUAGXX` (record format `01`):
       - Fields: `BACONO` (company number, positions 2–3), `BACUST` (customer number, positions 4–9), `BACOCU` (company/customer key, positions 2–9).
   - **Comment**:
     - Indicates the program removes the salesman number for customer report purposes.

2. **Calculation Specifications (C)** (Line 0015):
   - No explicit calculations are performed, as the program’s logic is handled entirely in the output specifications.

3. **Output Specifications (O)** (Lines 0016–0017):
   - **Output to `BICUAGXX`**:
     - Record format `D` (update) is used for each `BICUAGXX` record (record format `01`).
     - Updates position 258 (2 bytes) with the literal value `'00'`, effectively clearing the salesman number.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - The program ends after processing all `BICUAGXX` records, updating each with a cleared salesman number.

### **Business Rules**

1. **Salesman Number Clearing**:
   - For every record in `BICUAGXX`, set the salesman number field (position 258, 2 bytes) to `'00'`.
   - This ensures the salesman number does not influence sorting in a customer-focused report, as specified in the `BI941.ocl36` context (used when salesman selection is `SEL` and sort order is `N`).

2. **Unconditional Update**:
   - The update is applied to all records in `BICUAGXX` without any filtering or conditional logic, as no checks are performed in the calculation specifications.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - The program assumes `BICUAGXX` is properly formatted, with a 258-byte record structure, and that position 258 is reserved for the salesman number.

### **Tables Used**

The program uses the following file/table:
1. **BICUAGXX**:
   - Update file containing customer sales agreement data.
   - Fields: `BACONO` (company number), `BACUST` (customer number), `BACOCU` (company/customer key).
   - Updated with `'00'` in position 258 (salesman number).

### **External Programs Called**

- **None**:
  - The `BI9412` program does not call any external programs. It performs all processing internally, reading and updating `BICUAGXX`.

---

### **Summary**

- **Process Steps**:
  1. Define the `BICUAGXX` file for update.
  2. For each `BICUAGXX` record:
     - Update position 258 with `'00'` to clear the salesman number.
  3. Terminate after processing all records.

- **Business Rules**:
  - Clear the salesman number (position 258) to `'00'` for all `BICUAGXX` records to support customer-focused report sorting.

- **Tables Used**:
  - `BICUAGXX`.

- **External Programs Called**:
  - None.

This program is a simple utility that prepares the `BICUAGXX` file for customer report generation by removing salesman-specific data, aligning with the customer sort requirements in the `BI941` workflow.
