The **BB802A** RPGLE program is a component of the Customer Orders and Invoicing system, designed to populate a work file (`BB802W`) with open order header data from the `BBORDH` file. It is called by the **BB802C** CLP program, which sets up the query environment and file overrides. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### **Process Steps of the BB802A RPG Program**

The program reads records from the `BBORDH` file, processes them based on a level break (L1), and updates or adds corresponding records to the `BB802W` work file. The steps are straightforward, focusing on data transfer with minimal user interaction. Here’s a breakdown of the key process steps:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Purpose**: Sets up the program environment and initializes variables.
   - **Actions**:
     - Receives the input parameter: `p$fgrp` (1 character, file group: 'G' or 'Z').
     - Defines a key list (`klwrk`) for accessing the work file `BB802W`, using fields: `boco` (company), `bocust` (customer), `bordno` (order number), and `k$invn` (invoice number, initialized to zeros).
     - Defines `k$invn` as a field like `boinvn` (invoice number from `BBORDH`) and sets it to zeros.

2. **Main Processing Loop**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads `BBORDH` records and processes them based on a level break.
   - **Actions**:
     - Reads `BBORDH` records sequentially, with level break indicators (`L1`) set on fields `boco`, `bocust`, `bordno`, and `boinvn`.
     - When the level break indicator `*inl1` is on, executes the `updwrkf` subroutine to process the record.

3. **Update Work File (`updwrkf` Subroutine)**:
   - **Purpose**: Adds or updates records in the `BB802W` work file based on `BBORDH` data.
   - **Actions**:
     - Uses the `klwrk` key list (`boco`, `bocust`, `bordno`, `k$invn`) to check if a matching record exists in `BB802W` using `SETLL` (sets `*in99` if no match).
     - If no matching record exists (`*in99 = *off`), chains to `BB802W` to verify existence (`*in99 = *on` if not found).
     - If the record does not exist (`*in99 = *on`):
       - Clears the `BB802W` record format (`bb802wpf`).
       - Maps fields from `BBORDH` to `BB802W`:
         - `w1co` ← `boco` (company)
         - `w1cust` ← `bocust` (customer)
         - `w1ord#` ← `bordno` (order number)
         - `w1inv#` ← `k$invn` (invoice number, zeros)
         - `w1ship` ← `boship` (ship-to code)
         - `w1pord` ← `bopord` (purchase order)
         - `w1slmn` ← `boslmn` (salesman)
         - `w1crid` ← `bortg1` (carrier ID)
         - `w1carn` ← `bocar` (carrier name)
         - `w1sdat` ← `borqd8` (request date)
         - `w1frcd` ← `bofrcd` (freight code)
         - `w1sfrt` ← `bosfrt` (ship freight)
         - `w1cafr` ← `bocafr` (carrier freight)
         - `w1cacd` ← `bocacd` (carrier code)
         - `w1oori` ← `'O'` (order origin indicator)
         - Additional fields (per jk01):
           - `w1tkby` ← `botkby` (taken by)
           - `w1rush` ← `borush` (rush order flag)
           - `w1gpby` ← `bogpby` (group by)
           - `w1racd` ← `boracd` (reason code)
           - `w1mulo` ← `bomulo` (multi-order flag)
           - `w1mlcd` ← `bomlcd` (multi-code)
           - `w1tolo` ← `botolo` (total order)
           - `w1loda` ← `boloda` (load date)
           - `w1lovo` ← `bolovo` (load volume)
       - Writes the new record to `BB802W` (`write bb802wpf`).
     - If a matching record exists (`*in99 = *off`), no update is performed (implicitly skips to the next record).

4. **Program Termination**:
   - **Purpose**: Completes processing and exits.
   - **Actions**:
     - Ends the program after processing all `BBORDH` records, closing files implicitly (as `BBORDH` and `BB802W` are defined with `ip` and `uf` respectively).

### **Business Rules**

1. **Work File Population**:
   - The program adds records to `BB802W` from `BBORDH` for open order headers, using a fixed invoice number of zeros (`k$invn = *zeros`) to align with the query structure set by **BB802C**.
   - Only adds new records if no matching record exists in `BB802W` (based on `boco`, `bocust`, `bordno`, `k$invn`).

2. **Level Break Processing**:
   - Processes `BBORDH` records on a level break (`L1`) defined by `boco` (company), `bocust` (customer), `bordno` (order number), and `boinvn` (invoice number).
   - Ensures records are processed only when the level break occurs, optimizing performance.

3. **Field Mapping**:
   - Maps specific fields from `BBORDH` to `BB802W`, preserving key order and inquiry data (e.g., customer, order, ship-to, salesman, freight details).
   - Includes additional fields added in revision jk01 to support enhanced inquiry capabilities (e.g., rush order, load date, total order).

4. **File Group Handling**:
   - Relies on `p$fgrp` ('G' or 'Z') set by **BB802C** to access the correct library (`GBBORDH` or `ZBBORDH`) via overrides in the CLP.

5. **Data Integrity**:
   - Uses `SETLL` and `CHAIN` to ensure no duplicate records are written to `BB802W`.
   - Clears the record format before writing to prevent residual data.

6. **Revision-Specific Rules**:
   - **jk01**: Added fields to `BB802W` (`w1tkby`, `w1rush`, `w1gpby`, `w1racd`, `w1mulo`, `w1mlcd`, `w1tolo`, `w1loda`, `w1lovo`) to capture additional order header data (e.g., taken by, rush flag, load volume).

---

### **Tables Used**

The program accesses the following database files:

1. **BBORDH**: Open order header file (input primary, `ip`), contains order header data (e.g., `boco`, `bocust`, `bordno`, `boinvn`, `boship`, etc.).
2. **BB802W**: Work file (update file, `uf`), stores processed inquiry data in `QTEMP` with fields like `w1co`, `w1cust`, `w1ord#`, `w1inv#`, etc.

---

### **External Programs Called**

The program does not call any external programs. It operates independently, relying on file I/O operations and the environment set up by **BB802C** (e.g., file overrides and open query).

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Indicator Usage**: Uses `*inl1` for level break processing and `*in99` for file access control (`SETLL` and `CHAIN` operations).
- **Field Prefixes**: Uses `w1` prefix for `BB802W` fields, aligning with the work file structure.
- **Key List**: The `klwrk` key list ensures unique identification of records in `BB802W` using `boco`, `bocust`, `bordno`, and `k$invn`.
- **Context**: Called by **BB802C** in `ORH` mode (open order header processing), where `BBORDH` is queried with a selection string (`QRYSLT`) to filter records.
- **Efficiency**: The program uses a simple, non-interactive approach, focusing on data transfer to the work file, with no user interface or message handling.

This program is a critical backend component of the inquiry system, ensuring that open order header data is efficiently transferred to the `BB802W` work file for further processing by the **BB802** inquiry interface.
