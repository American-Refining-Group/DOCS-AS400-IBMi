The provided document is an OCL (Operation Control Language) program, `BB9565.ocl36.txt`, used on IBM midrange systems like the AS/400 (now IBM i). This program is called conditionally from the main OCL program `BB956P.ocl36.txt` when the condition at `?L'207,1'?` is `'Y'`. It is part of the rack pricing update process, likely responsible for processing or updating pricing data. Below is an explanation of the process steps, external programs called, and tables (files) used.

### **Process Steps of the OCL Program `BB9565`**

The `BB9565` OCL program is concise and serves to execute an RPG (or similar) program with specified input files. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Load the Program**:
   - `// LOAD BB9565`:
     - Loads the program `BB9565`, which is likely an RPG program or another executable on the system, responsible for processing data related to rack pricing updates.

2. **File Definitions**:
   - The program specifies two files to be used by `BB9565`:
     - `// FILE NAME-NEWPROD,LABEL-?9?NWPROD,DISP-SHR`:
       - Defines the `NEWPROD` file (new product or pricing file) with the label `?9?NWPROD` (prefixed by the library/environment `?9?`) and shared access (`DISP-SHR`).
     - `// FILE NAME-PRCTUM,LABEL-?9?PRCTUM,DISP-SHR`:
       - Defines the `PRCTUM` file (customer master file) with the label `?9?PRCTUM` and shared access (`DISP-SHR`).

3. **Execute the Program**:
   - `// RUN`:
     - Executes the `BB9565` program, which processes the input files `NEWPROD` and `PRCTUM`.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - The OCL script ends after the `RUN` command, with no additional logic or conditional processing defined.

### **Business Rules (Inferred)**

Since the OCL program itself does not contain explicit business logic (it only sets up and runs `BB9565`), the business rules are inferred based on its context within the rack pricing update process and the files involved:
1. **Purpose**:
   - The `BB9565` program likely processes or updates the `NEWPROD` file (generated by earlier programs like `BB9563`) using data from the `PRCTUM` customer master file, possibly to finalize pricing updates, integrate new pricing records into the customer master, or perform validation.
2. **Input Processing**:
   - Uses `NEWPROD` as the source of new pricing data (e.g., company, location, product, container, and unit of measure from `BB9563`).
   - Uses `PRCTUM` for customer-related data (e.g., company number, customer number, product code, container code, unit of measure).
3. **Shared Access**:
   - Both files are accessed in shared mode (`DISP-SHR`), indicating that multiple processes can read these files simultaneously.
4. **Output**:
   - The OCL does not specify an output file, suggesting that `BB9565` either updates `PRCTUM` or `NEWPROD` in place or produces output through other means (e.g., a report or another file defined within the RPG program).

### **External Programs Called**

The OCL program explicitly calls the following external program:
1. **BB9565**:
   - Loaded and executed with the `LOAD` and `RUN` commands, this program performs the core processing logic using the `NEWPROD` and `PRCTUM` files.

---

### **Tables (Files) Used**

The program interacts with the following files:
1. **Input Files**:
   - `NEWPROD` (labeled `?9?NWPROD`): New product or pricing file, likely containing pricing data generated by previous programs (e.g., `BB9563`).
   - `PRCTUM` (labeled `?9?PRCTUM`): Customer master file, containing customer numbers, company numbers, product codes, container codes, and unit of measure.

### **Summary**

The `BB9565.ocl36` program is a simple OCL script that loads and executes the `BB9565` program as part of the rack pricing update process. It specifies two input files: `NEWPROD` (new pricing data) and `PRCTUM` (customer master data), both accessed in shared mode. The program is called conditionally from the main OCL (`BB956P.ocl36`) when the condition at `?L'207,1'?` is `'Y'`. The only external program called is `BB9565`, and the files used are `NEWPROD` and `PRCTUM`. The specific processing logic (e.g., updating `PRCTUM`, validating data, or generating reports) is handled by the `BB9565` program, which is not detailed in the OCL.
