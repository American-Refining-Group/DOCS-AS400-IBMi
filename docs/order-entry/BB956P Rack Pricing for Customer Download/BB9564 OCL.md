The provided document is an OCL (Operation Control Language) program, `BB9564.ocl36.txt`, used on IBM midrange systems like the AS/400 (now IBM i). This program is called conditionally from the main OCL program `BB956P.ocl36.txt` when `SWITCH2` is set to `1`. It appears to be part of the rack pricing update process, likely responsible for further processing or updating pricing data. Below is an explanation of the process steps, external programs called, and tables (files) used.

### **Process Steps of the OCL Program `BB9564`**

The `BB9564` OCL program is concise and serves to execute an RPG (or similar) program with specified input files. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Load the Program**:
   - `// LOAD BB9564`:
     - Loads the program `BB9564`, which is likely an RPG program or another executable on the system, responsible for processing data related to rack pricing updates.

2. **File Definitions**:
   - The program specifies two files to be used by `BB9564`:
     - `// FILE NAME-NEWPROD,LABEL-?9?NWPROD,DISP-SHR`:
       - Defines the `NEWPROD` file (new product or pricing file) with the label `?9?NWPROD` (prefixed by the library/environment `?9?`) and shared access (`DISP-SHR`).
     - `// FILE NAME-PRCTUM,LABEL-?9?PRCTUM,DISP-SHR`:
       - Defines the `PRCTUM` file (customer master file) with the label `?9?PRCTUM` and shared access (`DISP-SHR`).

3. **Execute the Program**:
   - `// RUN`:
     - Executes the `BB9564` program, which processes the input files `NEWPROD` and `PRCTUM`.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - The OCL script ends after the `RUN` command, with no additional logic or conditional processing defined.

### **Business Rules (Inferred)**

Since the OCL program itself does not contain explicit business logic (it only sets up and runs `BB9564`), the business rules are inferred based on its context within the rack pricing update process and the files involved:
1. **Purpose**:
   - The `BB9564` program likely processes or updates the `NEWPROD` file (generated by earlier programs like `BB9563`) using data from the `PRCTUM` customer master file, possibly to finalize pricing updates or integrate new pricing records into the customer master.
2. **Input Processing**:
   - Uses `NEWPROD` as the source of new pricing data (e.g., company, location, product, container, and unit of measure from `BB9563`).
   - Uses `PRCTUM` for customer-related data (e.g., company number, customer number, product code, container code, unit of measure).
3. **Shared Access**:
   - Both files are accessed in shared mode (`DISP-SHR`), indicating that multiple processes can read these files simultaneously.
4. **Output**:
   - The OCL does not specify an output file, suggesting that `BB9564` either updates `PRCTUM` or `NEWPROD` in place or produces output through other means (e.g., a report or another file defined within the RPG program).

### **External Programs Called**

The OCL program explicitly calls the following external program:
1. **BB9564**:
   - Loaded and executed with the `LOAD` and `RUN` commands, this program performs the core processing logic using the `NEWPROD` and `PRCTUM` files.

---

### **Tables (Files) Used**

The program interacts with the following files:
1. **Input Files**:
   - `NEWPROD` (labeled `?9?NWPROD`): New product or pricing file, likely containing pricing data generated by previous programs (e.g., `BB9563`).
   - `PRCTUM` (labeled `?9?PRCTUM`): Customer master file, containing customer numbers, company numbers, product codes, container codes, and unit of measure.

### **Summary**

The `BB9564.ocl36` program is a simple OCL script that loads and executes the `BB9564` program as part of the rack pricing update process. It specifies two input files: `NEWPROD` (new pricing data) and `PRCTUM` (customer master data), both accessed in shared mode. The program is called conditionally from the main OCL (`BB956P.ocl36`) when `SWITCH2` is set to `1`. The only external program called is `BB9564`, and the files used are `NEWPROD` and `PRCTUM`. The specific processing logic (e.g., updating `PRCTUM` or generating reports) is handled by the `BB9564` program, which is not detailed in the OCL.
