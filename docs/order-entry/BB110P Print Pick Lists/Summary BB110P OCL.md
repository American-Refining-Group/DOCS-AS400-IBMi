The query refers to the "entire call stack" and "these programs," which, based on the conversation history, likely pertains to the `BB110.rpg36.txt` RPG program and its caller `BB110P.ocl36` on an IBM System/36, as described previously. The `BB110` program generates various reports (picking tickets, order confirmations, proforma invoices, traffic reports) and updates order-related data, while `BB110P` handles batch selection and validation before calling `BB110`. Below, I’ll list the use cases implemented across these programs and provide a concise functional requirements document for one use case, treating it as a large function that processes inputs without screen interaction.

### Use Cases Implemented by BB110 and BB110P

The combined functionality of `BB110P` (batch selection and validation) and `BB110` (report generation and data updates) supports the following use cases, derived from the program descriptions and modifications:

1. **Select and Validate Orders for Processing (BB110P)**:
   - Selects orders in batch mode, validates them (e.g., checks for EDI errors, deletion status), and passes valid orders to `BB110` for report generation.

2. **Generate Picking Ticket (BB110, LIST)**:
   - Produces standard picking tickets, including an EDI Viscosity version (JB15, JB18), with order details, quantities, weights, and dispatch marks.

3. **Generate Packaging Plant Pick Sheet (BB110, LIST2)**:
   - Creates pick sheets for the packaging plant (JB19, JB20, JK02), with size, brand, description, quantity, gross weight, and gallons.

4. **Generate Order Confirmation (BB110, LIST3)**:
   - Prints order confirmations (MG41) with customer/ship-to details, payment terms, Incoterms, totals, and standard notes, skipping credit checks (MG64).

5. **Generate Proforma Invoice (BB110, LIST4)**:
   - Generates proforma invoices (MG64) with order details, totals, and Incoterms, formatted for pre-invoicing purposes.

6. **Generate Traffic Report (BB110, TRAFFP)**:
   - Produces a traffic report (MG29) listing orders with multiple freight tables, including order number, customer, carrier, and requested date.

7. **Update Order and Shipment Data (BB110)**:
   - Updates files (`BBOTHS1`, `BBORTU`, `BBOTDS1`, `BBSRNH`, `SHPADR`) with freight details, product descriptions, and statuses for downstream processing.

  - `BBSRNH`: Shipping reference numbers.

## Process Steps
1. **Validate Inputs** (from `BB110P`):
   - Confirm order is valid (not `BODEL = 'E'` or `'D'` unless internal freight processor).
   - Initialize variables, clear fields (e.g., `HAZMAT`, `PPDSC1`–`PPDSC3`), set system date/time.

2. **Retrieve Order Data**:
   - Chain to `BBORTR` using `BOCO`, `BORDNO` for header data.
   - Mark order as “PRELIMINARY” or “FINAL” based on `BOORPR = 'R'` or `'C'`.

3. **Retrieve Customer and Ship-to Data**:
   - Chain to `ARCUST` for customer name/address.
   - Call `MSHPADR` for ship-to address (`SDNAME`, `SDADR1`, etc.), passing `SDCTY`.
   - Chain to `EDICUS` for EDI `'856'` shipper details if applicable.

4. **Retrieve Freight Processor Data**:
   - Chain to `BBFRPR` using `BOFPCD`.
   - Use customer address (`FRNML`, `FRA1L`) for internal processors (`FPFPTY ≠ 'EXT'`); else use `FPNAME`, `FPADR1`.
   - Update `BBOTHS1` with freight/carrier details.

5. **Process Detail Lines**:
   - Chain to `BBOTDS1`, skip `BDDEL = 'D'`.
   - Retrieve product descriptions (`TBDES2` from `GSPROD`, `CPCPDS` from `ARCUPR`).
   - Chain to `GSCNTR1` for container descriptions, `GSCTUM` for unit conversions.
   - Calculate extended price: `EXTPRCJB = BDQTY * NEWPRCJ`.

6. **Calculate Totals**:
   - Net quantity (`L2CQT`): Sum `BDQTY`.
   - Gross weight (`L2GWT`): Sum `BDGWT`.
   - Net weight (`L2NWT`): Sum `BDPRWT`.
   - Total price (`TOTPRCJB`): Sum `BDQTY * NEWPRCJ`.
   - Freight (`L2FRT`): Sum `BDFRRT` and accessorials.
   - Gallons (`L2NGAL`): Convert using `MINLBGL1`, handle container `420` (quarts).

7. **Retrieve Remarks and Marks**:
   - Chain to `BBORTO`, `BBOTA1` for remarks (`BXOMK1`–`BXOMK4`), dispatch marks (`BXDSP1`–`BXDSP4`) if `BADSPH = 'Y'`.
   - Chain to `ARCUFMX` for email addresses (`EIFM`).

8. **Generate Report**:
   - Print header: Company, order number, customer, ship-to, salesman, date/time.
   - Print sold-to/ship-to addresses, ship date, delivery time, contact, carrier, routing, PO numbers, payment terms (`BOTERM` with `ARTDSC`), Incoterms.
   - Print detail lines: Size, brand, description, quantity, gross weight, unit, price, extended price.
   - Print totals: Net quantity, weights, charges, price, freight.
   - Print freight bill address and standard notes (`NTE`).

9. **Update Files**:
   - Update `BBOTHS1`, `BBOTDS1`, `BBORTU`, `SHPADR`, `BBSRNH`.
   - Set `BOPPIK = 'Y'`, update `BOFPST`, `BOVERN`.
   - Release record locks in `SHPADR`, `BBOTHS1`.

## Business Rules
1. **Order Validation**:
   - Skip orders with `BODEL = 'E'` (EDI error) or `'D'` (deleted) unless internal freight processor.
   - Treat `BOORPR = 'R'` as `'C'` for final confirmation.
   - Mark `BOORPR = 'H'` orders as “ON HOLD - DO NOT SHIP”.

2. **Freight Processing**:
   - Internal processors (`FPFPTY ≠ 'EXT'`): Use customer address.
   - External processors: Use freight processor address.
   - Include freight bill address for third-party freight.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Net quantity: Sum `BDQTY` for non-deleted lines.
   - Gross weight: Sum `BDGWT`.
   - Net weight: Sum `BDPRWT`.
   - Total price: Sum `BDQTY * NEWPRCJ`.
   - Freight: Sum `BDFRRT` and accessorials.
   - Gallons: Convert via `MINLBGL1`, special handling for container `420` (quarts).

4. **Printing**:
   - Include payment terms (`ARTDSC`), Incoterms, and “FOB SHIPPING POINT” if applicable.
   - Print loading locations (`GMMLDS`, `GMLOD1`–`GMLOD3`).
   - Include up to four email addresses (`EIFM`).
   - Print standard notes (`NTE`) with terms, safety, export rules.

5. **File Updates**:
   - Write descriptions to `BBOTDS1` (JB51).
   - Release record locks to prevent conflicts.
   - Update `BOPPIK`, `BOFPST`, `BOVERN`.

## External Dependencies
- **MSHPADR**: Retrieves ship-to addresses.
- **MINLBGL1**: Calculates gallons/pounds for conversions.

## Assumptions
- Orders are pre-validated by `BB110P`.
- Required files are accessible and formatted correctly.
- Printer device (`LPRINTER`, U6) is available.
- No credit limit check for confirmations.

## Error Handling
- Skip invalid/deleted records.
- Retry missing `ARCUPR` records with blank/`'P'` container type.
- Log errors for missing file records using indicators.
