The `BB005.rpg36.txt` is an **RPG II** program running on an IBM System/36, designed to release or post batches in the order entry process. It is called by the `BB110P.ocl36` program during the batch release phase. The program updates the `BBBTCH` file based on the program mode (`PGM`) and batch number (`BATCH#`). Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables (files) used, and any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the BB005 RPG Program

The program performs a single, focused task: updating the batch status in the `BBBTCH` file based on the mode specified in the `PGM` field. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Retrieve Batch Record**:
   - **Line 0011**: Uses the batch number (`BATCH#`, from LDA offset 490–491) to chain to the `BBBTCH` file. If the batch is not found, indicator 99 is set, and the program skips further processing.

2. **Process Batch Based on Program Mode**:
   - **Line 0013**: If the batch is found (`N99`), enters a `DO` loop to process the batch update.
   - **Lines 0015–0031**: Checks the `PGM` field (from LDA offset 504) to determine the update type:
     - **If `PGM = 'O'` (Order Entry)**:
       - Executes the `REL` output operation to release the batch.
     - **If `PGM = 'L'` (Pick List)**:
       - Executes the `PICK` output operation to update the batch for pick list processing.
     - **If `PGM = 'B'` (Bill of Lading)**:
       - Executes the `BOL` output operation to mark the batch as printed for the Bill of Lading.
     - **If `PGM = 'P'` (Posting)**:
       - Executes the `POST` output operation to post the batch.
     - **Default (if `PGM` is none of the above)**:
       - Executes the `REL` output operation as a fallback.

3. **Update Batch File**:
   - **Lines 0038–0058**: Defines output operations for `BBBTCH`:
     - **REL (Lines 0038–0041)**:
       - Clears lock status (`ABLOCK`, position 6) to `' '`.
       - Clears lock workstation ID (`ABLKWS`, position 8) to `'  '`.
       - Updates record count (`ABREC`, position 32–39) with `RECCNT` (from LDA offset 475–482).
     - **PICK (Lines 0043–0047)**:
       - Clears lock status (`ABLOCK`, position 6) to `' '`.
       - Clears lock workstation ID (`ABLKWS`, position 8) to `'  '`.
       - Updates record count (`ABREC`, position 32–39) with `RECCNT`.
     - **BOL (Lines 0049–0053)**:
       - Clears lock status (`ABLOCK`, position 6) to `' '`.
       - Clears lock workstation ID (`ABLKWS`, position 8) to `'  '`.
       - Sets BOL printed flag (`ABPRTD`, position 9) to `'Y'`.
       - Updates record count (`ABREC`, position 32–39) with `RECCNT`.
     - **POST (Lines 0055–0058)**:
       - Sets delete code (`ABDEL`, position 1) to `'D'`.
       - Sets lock status (`ABLOCK`, position 6) to `'P'` (posted).
       - Updates record count (`ABREC`, position 32–39) with `RECCNT`.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - **Line 0035**: Sets the Last Record (`LR`) indicator to terminate the program after processing.

### Business Rules

1. **Batch Existence**:
   - The batch number (`BATCH#`) must exist in the `BBBTCH` file. If not found, no updates are performed, and the program exits.

2. **Program Mode Handling**:
   - The `PGM` field determines the batch update type:
     - `'O'`: Releases the batch, clearing lock fields.
     - `'L'`: Updates the batch for pick list processing, clearing lock fields.
     - `'B'`: Marks the batch as printed for the Bill of Lading, setting `ABPRTD = 'Y'`.
     - `'P'`: Posts the batch, marking it as deleted (`ABDEL = 'D'`) and setting `ABLOCK = 'P'`.
     - Any other value defaults to releasing the batch (`REL`).

3. **Record Count Update**:
   - The record count (`RECCNT`, from LDA) is updated in the `BBBTCH` file’s `ABREC` field for all operations.

4. **Lock Management**:
   - For `REL`, `PICK`, and `BOL` operations, the batch is unlocked by clearing `ABLOCK` and `ABLKWS`.
   - For `POST`, the batch is marked as posted (`ABLOCK = 'P'`) and deleted (`ABDEL = 'D'`).

5. **Minimal Error Handling**:
   - The program assumes valid input from the calling OCL program and does not perform extensive validation beyond checking if the batch exists.

### Tables (Files) Used

1. **BBBTCH**:
   - **Type**: Indexed disk file (48 bytes, update-capable, shared access).
   - **Purpose**: Stores and updates batch control data, including lock status, workstation ID, BOL printed flag, delete code, and record count.
   - **Fields Updated**:
     - `ABDEL` (position 1): Delete code (set to `'D'` for `POST`).
     - `ABLOCK` (position 6): Lock status (cleared to `' '` for `REL`, `PICK`, `BOL`; set to `'P'` for `POST`).
     - `ABLKWS` (position 7–8): Lock workstation ID (cleared to `'  '` for `REL`, `PICK`, `BOL`).
     - `ABPRTD` (position 9): BOL printed flag (set to `'Y'` for `BOL`).
     - `ABREC` (position 32–39): Record count (updated with `RECCNT`).

### External Programs Called

- **None**: The `BB005` program does not explicitly call any external RPG programs. It performs a single, focused update operation on the `BBBTCH` file and relies on the calling OCL program (`BB110P.ocl36`) for context and further processing.

### Summary

The `BB005` RPG program is a simple utility that updates the `BBBTCH` file to release, process, or post a batch based on the `PGM` mode:
- Retrieves the batch record using `BATCH#`.
- Updates lock status, BOL printed flag, delete code, and record count based on the mode (`O`, `L`, `B`, or `P`).
- Terminates after updating the batch.

**Tables Used**: BBBTCH.
**External Programs Called**: None.
