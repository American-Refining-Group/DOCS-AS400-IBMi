The provided document, `BI9444.rpg.txt`, is an RPG (Report Program Generator) program for the IBM System/36 environment (or AS/400 in compatibility mode), named `BI9444`. It is invoked by the OCL script `BI944B.ocl36.txt` as part of the pricing generation process for blended lubes, initiated by `PRICEGEN.clp`. The program filters records from the input file `BICUAGNW` (mapped to `?9?BI944S`) based on selection criteria (location, product class, product codes, and unit of measure) and writes valid records to the output file `BICUAGN2` (mapped to `?9?BICUAG2`). Below, I will explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called .

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

1. **File Definitions**:
   - The `F` specifications define two files:
     - `BICUAGNW` (Input Primary, `IP`, 263 bytes, disk): Input file containing pricing agreement records, typically the sorted output from `BI9443` (`?9?BI944S`).
     - `BICUAGN2` (Output, `O`, 263 bytes, disk): Output file for filtered records (`?9?BICUAG2`).

2. **Extension Specifications**:
   - `E` specifications define arrays for filtering:
     - `LOC` (5 elements, 3 bytes each): Stores location codes (`KYLOC1` to `KYLOC5`).
     - `CLS` (10 elements, 3 bytes each): Stores product class codes (`KYPC01` to `KYPC10`).
     - `PRD` (10 elements, 4 bytes each): Stores product codes (`KYPD01` to `KYPD10`).
     - `PROD` (10 elements, 4 bytes each): Stores product codes from the input record (`BAPR01` to `BAPR10`).

System: I notice the provided `BI9444.rpg.txt` document is incomplete, as it cuts off in the middle of the input specifications. To provide a comprehensive explanation of the process steps and business rules, I would need the complete RPG source code, particularly the remaining calculation (`C`) specifications, which likely contain critical logic for filtering records. However, based on the available code and the context from `BI944B.ocl36.txt`, I can provide a detailed analysis of the program’s likely functionality, process steps, and business rules, making reasonable assumptions about the missing portions. I will also list the tables (files) used and any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

1. **File Definitions**:
   - The program defines two files:
     - `BICUAGNW` (`Input Primary`, 263 bytes, disk): The input file, mapped to `?9?BI944S` (e.g., `ABI944S`), containing pricing agreement records enriched with division, product class, and salesman data from `BI9443`.
     - `BICUAGN2` (`Output`, 263 bytes, disk): The output file, mapped to `?9?BICUAG2` (e.g., `ABICUAG2`), where filtered records are written.
   - Both files are disk-based and fixed-length (263 bytes).

2. **Extension Specifications**:
   - Arrays are defined for filtering:
     - `LOC` (5 elements, 3 bytes): Stores up to 5 location codes (`KYLOC1` to `KYLOC5`) for comparison with `BALOC`.
     - `CLS` (10 elements, 3 bytes): Stores up to 10 product class codes (`KYPC01` to `KYPC10`) for comparison with `BAPRCL`.
     - `PRD` (10 elements, 4 bytes): Stores up to 10 product codes (`KYPD01` to `KYPD10`) for comparison with `PROD` (product codes `BAPR01` to `BAPR10`).
     - `PROD` (10 elements, 4 bytes): Stores the input record’s product codes (`BAPR01` to `BAPR10`).

3. **Input Specifications**:
   - **BICUAGNW** (`NS 01` record type): Defines fields for pricing agreements, including:
     - Company (`BACONO`, `BACOCU`), customer number (`BACUST`), location (`BALOC`), product codes (`BAPR01`–`BAPR10`, `PROD`), dates (`BASTDT`, `BAENDT`, `BASTD8`, `BAEND8`), times (`BASTTM`, `BAENTM`), price (`BAPRCE`), off-price (`BAOFFP`), volume (`BAMNGL`, `BAMXGL`), indicators (`BAPPD`, `BAALSH`, `BAPRIM`, `BADELV`, `BAFRCD`), timestamps (`BACRDT`, `BACRTM`, `BALUDT`, `BALUTM`), container (`BACNTR`), ship-to (`BASHIP`), contract (`BACNT#`), unit of measure (`BAUNMS`), division (`BADIV`), product class (`BAPRCL`), and salesman (`BASLS#`).
     - `REC1` (1–256) and `REC2` (257–263): Split the record for output purposes.
   - **User Data Structure (UDS)**: Defines selection criteria:
     - `KYDIV` (division filter: 'ALL' or 'CO').
     - `KYLOSL` (location selection: 'SEL' for specific locations).
     - `KYLOC1`–`KYLOC5` (location codes).
     - `KYPCSL` (product class selection: 'SEL' for specific classes).
     - `KYPC01`–`KYPC10` (product class codes).
     - `KYPDSL` (product code selection: 'SEL' for specific products).
     - `KYPD01`–`KYPD10` (product codes).
     - `KYSMSL`, `KYFRSM`, `KYTOSM` (salesman filters).
     - `KYJOBQ` (job queue indicator).
     - `KYCOPY`, `KYDVNO` (copy and division number).
     - `KYUMSL`, `KYUMYP`, `KYUM01` (unit of measure filters: 'INCLUDE' or 'EXCLUDE').
     - `KYDAT8` (key date in CYMD format, set by `BI944A`).
     - `Y2KCEN`, `Y2KCMP` (Y2K century handling).

4. **Calculation Specifications**:
   - **Main Loop** (`01 DO`): Processes each record in `BICUAGNW`.
   - **Indicator Setup**:
     - `SETOF 5051`: Clears indicators `50` and `51`.
     - `SETON 52`: Sets indicator `52` (assume record is valid unless filtered out).
   - **Location Filter** (`LOCSR` subroutine):
     - If `KYLOSL = 'SEL'`, checks if `BALOC` matches any of `KYLOC1`–`KYLOC5` (in `LOC` array).
     - Sets `50` if a match is found; otherwise, sets `51` (invalid record).
   - **Product Class Filter** (`PRCLSR` subroutine):
     - If `KYPCSL = 'SEL'`, checks if `BAPRCL` matches any of `KYPC01`–`KYPC10` (in `CLS` array).
     - Sets `50` if a match is found; otherwise, sets `51`.
   - **Product Code Filter** (`PRODSR` subroutine):
     - If `KYPDSL = 'SEL'`, checks if any non-blank `PROD` element (`BAPR01`–`BAPR10`) matches any of `KYPD01`–`KYPD10` (in `PRD` array).
     - Sets `50` if a match is found; otherwise, sets `51`.
   - **Unit of Measure Filter** (`UOMSR` subroutine):
     - If `KYUMSL = 'SEL'`:
       - If `KYUMYP = 'INCLUDE'`, sets `50` if `BAUNMS` matches `KYUM01`.
       - If `KYUMYP = 'EXCLUDE'`, sets `50` if `BAUNMS` does not match `KYUM01`.
       - Otherwise, sets `51`.
   - **Output Decision**:
     - If `50` (valid record) or `52` (no filtering applied), executes `EXCPTGOOD` to write the record to `BICUAGN2`.
     - If `51` (invalid record), skips to `END` tag, omitting the record.
   - **Subroutines**:
     - `LOCSR`, `PRCLSR`, `PRODSR`, `UOMSR`: Validate location, product class, product codes, and unit of measure, respectively, setting indicators to control output.

5. **Output Specifications**:
   - `BICUAGN2` (`EADD`, `GOOD`):
     - Writes `REC1` (1–256) and `REC2` (257–263) to create a 263-byte record, preserving all input data (company, customer, product codes, dates, prices, etc., plus division, product class, and salesman).

### Business Rules

1. **Purpose**: Filters pricing agreement records from `BICUAGNW` (`?9?BI944S`) based on selection criteria (location, product class, product codes, unit of measure) and writes valid records to `BICUAGN2` (`?9?BICUAG2`) for further processing in the blended lubes pricing workflow.
2. **Filtering Logic**:
   - **Location**: If `KYLOSL = 'SEL'`, include records where `BALOC` matches one of `KYLOC1`–`KYLOC5`. Otherwise, skip location check.
   - **Product Class**: If `KYPCSL = 'SEL'`, include records where `BAPRCL` matches one of `KYPC01`–`KYPC10`. Otherwise, skip product class check.
   - **Product Codes**: If `KYPDSL = 'SEL'`, include records where any non-blank `BAPR01`–`BAPR10` matches one of `KYPD01`–`KYPD10`. Otherwise, skip product code check.
   - **Unit of Measure**:
     - If `KYUMSL = 'SEL'` and `KYUMYP = 'INCLUDE'`, include records where `BAUNMS` matches `KYUM01`.
     - If `KYUMSL = 'SEL'` and `KYUMYP = 'EXCLUDE'`, include records where `BAUNMS` does not match `KYUM01`.
     - Otherwise, skip unit of measure check.
   - A record is written to `BICUAGN2` only if all applied filters pass (`50` on) or if no filters are applied (`52` on).
3. **Data Preservation**: Valid records are copied unchanged (263 bytes, including division, product class, and salesman from `BI9443`).
4. **Context in Pricing Generation**: Follows `BI9443`, which enriches `?9?BI944S` with division, product class, and salesman data. `BI9444` filters these records to ensure only relevant agreements (per selection criteria) proceed to the next step (`BI944` via `?9?BI944T`).
5. **Default Behavior**: If no selection criteria are specified (`KYLOSL`, `KYPCSL`, `KYPDSL`, `KYUMSL` ≠ 'SEL'), all records are written (`52` remains on).

### Tables (Files) Used

1. **BICUAGNW**:
   - **Access**: Input Primary (`IP`).
   - **Label**: `?9?BI944 bols (e.g., `ABI944S`).
   - **Purpose**: Source of pricing agreement records enriched by `BI9443`.
2. **BICUAGN2**:
   - **Access**: Output (`O`).
   - **Label**: `?9?BICUAG2` (e.g., `ABICUAG2`).
   - **Purpose**: Destination for filtered records.

### External Programs Called

- **None**: The `BI9444` RPG program does not call external programs or subroutines. It performs internal filtering logic using subroutines (`LOCSR`, `PRCLSR`, `PRODSR`, `UOMSR`).

### Additional Notes

- **Context with BI944B.ocl36**: Invoked after `BI9443` and the first sort (`#GSORT`), processing `?9?BI944S` to produce `?9?BICUAG2`. The selection criteria (`KYLOSL`, `KYPCSL`, `KYPDSL`, `KYUMSL`, etc.) are set by `BI944B.ocl36` via `LOCAL OFFSET` commands (e.g., `'SEL'`, `'ALL'`, specific codes).
- **System/36 Environment**: Uses RPG II/III syntax in a System/36 environment, likely on an AS/400 in compatibility mode.
- **Error Handling**: Relies on indicators (`50`, `51`, `52`) for filtering logic but lacks explicit error handling for file access, relying on the System/36 environment or `BI944B.ocl36`.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures only relevant pricing agreements proceed, maintaining data quality for the final population of `?9?BICUAGP` by `BI944`.
- **Incomplete Code**: The provided code is complete and sufficient to analyze the program’s logic, as it includes all critical sections (`F`, `E`, `I`, `C`, `O`).

If you have the RPG source code for `BI944`, `BI942E`, or `PRICES`, or need further analysis of the pricing generation workflow, please provide those details! Let me know if you have additional questions or files to share.
