The provided document is an Operator Control Language (OCL) program, typically used in IBM midrange systems like the IBM System/36 or AS/400 for controlling job execution and system operations. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the process steps in the `BB715P.ocl36.txt` program, along with the external programs called and any tables used.

### Process Steps of the OCL Program

1. **Header Information and Initialization**:
   - The program starts with a header indicating it is a "DAILY REQUIREMENTS REPORT."
   - Comments or directives like `SCPROCP ,,,,,,,,?9?`, `GSY2K`, and `SWITCH 00000000` provide metadata or configuration:
     - `SCPROCP` likely specifies a procedure or program identifier, with `?9?` possibly being a placeholder for a parameter or system-specific value.
     - `GSY2K` may indicate a system configuration or version (possibly related to Y2K compliance).
     - `SWITCH 00000000` initializes a switch variable (8-bit) to all zeros, used for conditional logic later.
   - `LOCAL BLANK-*ALL` clears all local variables to blanks, ensuring a clean state for the job.

2. **Load and File Specification**:
   - `LOAD BB715P`: Loads the program or procedure named `BB715P` into memory for execution.
   - `FILE NAME-BICONT,LABEL-?9?BICONT,DISP-SHRRM`:
     - Specifies a file named `BICONT` to be used by the program.
     - `LABEL-?9?BICONT` suggests the file label includes a parameter (`?9?`), possibly dynamically set.
     - `DISP-SHRRM` indicates the file is opened in shared read mode, allowing multiple processes to read it simultaneously.

3. **Execution Command**:
   - `RUN`: Initiates the execution of the loaded program (`BB715P`).

4. **Conditional Logic Based on Switch**:
   - `IF SWITCH8-1 GOTO END`: Checks if the 8th bit of the switch variable is set to 1.
     - If true, the procedure is canceled (as indicated by the comment `'PROCEDURE IS CANCELLED'`), and control jumps to the `END` tag, terminating the program.

5. **Conditional Job Queue or Program Execution**:
   - `IF ?L'109,1'?/Y JOBQ ?CLIB?,BB715,,,,,,,,,?9?`:
     - Checks if the first character of a parameter at position 109 (`?L'109,1'?`) equals 'Y'.
     - If true, submits a job to a job queue:
       - `JOBQ ?CLIB?,BB715`: Submits the program `BB715` to the job queue defined by `?CLIB?` (likely a library or system parameter).
       - The `,,,,,,,,,?9?` indicates additional parameters, with `?9?` being a placeholder for a dynamic value.
   - `ELSE BB715 ,,,,,,,,?9?`:
     - If the condition is false (i.e., the character at position 109 is not 'Y'), the program `BB715` is executed directly (not queued), with `?9?` as a parameter.

6. **End of Program**:
   - `TAG END`: Defines a label (`END`) where the program jumps if the `SWITCH8-1` condition is met, effectively terminating the procedure.
   - The final `LOCAL BLANK-*ALL` and `SWITCH 00000000` reset local variables and the switch variable, ensuring a clean exit.

### External Programs Called

- **BB715**: This is the primary program or procedure executed or submitted to the job queue. It is referenced in the `LOAD`, `JOBQ`, and `ELSE` statements.
- No other external programs are explicitly mentioned in the OCL code.

### Tables Used

- **BICONT**: A file (likely a database or data file) is referenced with the name `BICONT` and label `?9?BICONT`. This is the only file explicitly mentioned, but no specific tables (e.g., database tables) are detailed in the OCL code.
- No additional tables or data structures are explicitly mentioned.

### Notes

- **Parameters (`?9?`, `?CLIB?`)**: The placeholders like `?9?` and `?CLIB?` suggest dynamic substitution of values at runtime, possibly defined by the calling environment or system configuration.
- **Conditional Logic**: The program uses simple conditional checks (`SWITCH8-1` and `?L'109,1'?/Y`) to control flow, typical of OCL's procedural nature.
- **File Access**: The use of `DISP-SHRRM` indicates the file `BICONT` is accessed in a shared read mode, suggesting it may be a critical data source for the report generation.
- **Limitations in Analysis**: Without additional context (e.g., the content of `BB715` or the structure of `BICONT`), the exact functionality of the report generation is unclear. The OCL code primarily sets up the environment and controls execution flow.

If you have additional details (e.g., the RPG code for `BB715` or the structure of `BICONT`), I can provide a more detailed analysis. Let me know if you need further clarification or specific aspects explored!
