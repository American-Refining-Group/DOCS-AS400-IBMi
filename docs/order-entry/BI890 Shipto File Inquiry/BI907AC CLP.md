The CLP (Control Language Program) `BI907AC.clp.txt` is part of the Brandford Order Entry / Invoices system and serves as a wrapper program to manage a work file and call the RPG program `BI907` for customer/ship-to product description and freight terms file maintenance. It is invoked from the main OCL program `BI890.ocl36.txt`, as referenced in the context of `BI890.rpg36.txt` (revision JB05), and integrates with the ship-to master maintenance workflow (`BI890`, `BI890P`, `BI8903`, `GB730P`, `BB800E`). Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called, based on the provided code and context.

### **Process Steps of the CLP Program**

The `BI907AC` program is a simple CLP that prepares a temporary work file and delegates the main processing to the RPG program `BI907`. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Parameter Declaration**:
   - Declares five input parameters:
     - `&P$CONO` (2 characters): Company number.
     - `&P$CUST` (6 characters): Customer number.
     - `&P$SHIP` (3 characters): Ship-to number.
     - `&P$MODE` (3 characters): Processing mode (e.g., inquiry, maintenance).
     - `&P$FGRP` (1 character): File group (`G` or `Z`) for file overrides.

2. **Work File Management**:
   - **Clear Work File**: Executes `CLRPFM` to clear the physical file `QTEMP/BI907W`. This ensures the work file is empty before processing.
   - **Handle Missing File**: Monitors for message `CPF3142` (file not found) using `MONMSG`. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates it using `CRTPF` with:
     - Source file: `QSRC` in `*LIBL`.
     - Options: `*NOSRC *NOLIST` (no source or listing).
     - Size: `*NOMAX` (unlimited records).
     - Authority: `*ALL` (full access).
   - **Override File**: Applies an override (`OVRDBF`) to redirect the logical file `BI907W` to the physical file `QTEMP/BI907W` (per revision JK01).

3. **Call RPG Program**:
   - Calls the RPG program `BI907`, passing the five parameters (`&P$CONO`, `&P$CUST`, `&P$SHIP`, `&P$MODE`, `&P$FGRP`) for customer/ship-to product description and freight terms maintenance.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Deletes the file override for `BI907W` using `DLTOVR` (per revision JK01).
   - Ends the program with `ENDPGM`.

### **Business Rules**

The program enforces the following business rules, based on the code and context:
1. **Work File Isolation**:
   - Uses a temporary file (`QTEMP/BI907W`) to ensure data is session-specific and does not persist across user sessions, enhancing security and preventing data conflicts.
   - Clears the work file before use and creates it if it doesn’t exist, ensuring a clean slate for `BI907`.

2. **Parameter Passing**:
   - Passes company, customer, ship-to, mode, and file group parameters to `BI907` without modification, ensuring `BI907` operates on the correct data and file set (`G` or `Z`).

3. **File Group Handling**:
   - Supports two file groups (`G` or `Z`) via `&P$FGRP`, which `BI907` uses to access the appropriate files (e.g., `garcupr` or `zarcupr` for product data).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles the absence of `QTEMP/BI907W` gracefully by creating it, ensuring the program doesn’t fail due to a missing work file.

5. **Integration with `BI907`**:
   - Acts as a front-end to `BI907`, which performs the actual file maintenance (e.g., updating `ARCUPR` for product descriptions and freight terms).

### **Tables (Files) Used**

The CLP program directly interacts with one file:
1. **BI907W** (Physical File, `QTEMP/BI907W`):
   - A temporary work file used by `BI907` for processing customer/ship-to product and freight terms data.
   - Cleared (`CLRPFM`) or created (`CRTPF`) as needed and overridden to `QTEMP/BI907W`.

No other files are directly referenced in the CLP, but `BI907` likely uses files such as `ARCUPR`, `GSPROD`, or others declared in the OCL (`BI890.ocl36.txt`), such as `arcupr`, `gsprod`, `gstabl`, `arcust`, `shipto`, `bicon`, `cuadr`, `bbshsa1`, `trrtcd`, `shipths`, `arcuphs`.

### **External Programs Called**

The program calls the following external program:
1. **BI907**:
   - An RPG program (not provided) that performs the core customer/ship-to product description and freight terms file maintenance, using the parameters and work file prepared by `BI907AC`.

No system programs (e.g., `QCMDEXC`) are directly called, but `CRTPF` and `OVRDBF` are CL commands that interact with the system. The OCL references `BI9002` and `BB800E`, but these are not called by `BI907AC`.

### **Summary**

The `BI907AC` CLP program is a wrapper for the `BI907` RPG program, called from the OCL (`BI890.ocl36.txt`) as part of the ship-to master maintenance workflow. It:
- Prepares a temporary work file (`QTEMP/BI907W`) by clearing or creating it and applying an override.
- Passes company, customer, ship-to, mode, and file group parameters to `BI907` for processing.
- Cleans up by deleting the file override.
- Enforces rules for work file isolation, parameter passing, and file group handling.

**Tables Used**:
- `BI907W` (`QTEMP/BI907W`, temporary work file)

**External Programs Called**:
- `BI907` (RPG program for file maintenance)
