The `BI8903.rpgle.txt` is an RPGLE (RPG IV) program named `BI8903`, designed for the Brandford Order Entry / Invoices system on an IBM AS/400 (iSeries) platform. It is responsible for copying ship-to records from one customer/ship-to combination to another, updating multiple related files. Below, I will explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called, based on the provided RPGLE source code.

### Process Steps

The program follows a structured flow to copy ship-to records and their associated data, organized into subroutines executed sequentially:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Parameters**: Receives six input parameters:
     - `p$co` (2 digits): Company number.
     - `p$fcust` (6 digits): Source customer number (copy from).
     - `p$fshp` (3 digits): Source ship-to number (copy from).
     - `p$tcust` (6 digits): Target customer number (copy to).
     - `p$tshp` (3 digits): Target ship-to number (copy to).
     - `p$fgrp` (1 character): File group identifier ('G' or 'Z') for file overrides.
   - **Field Setup**: Initializes key fields (`dsco`, `dstcust`, `dstshp`) with input parameters (`p$co`, `p$tcust`, `p$tshp`) for use in key lists.
   - **Key Lists**: Defines two key lists:
     - `klFrmShipto`: For accessing source records (`p$co`, `p$fcust`, `p$fshp`).
     - `KlToShipto`: For checking target records (`p$co`, `p$tcust`, `p$tshp`).
   - **Data Structures**: Defines external data structures (`wkds01`, `wkds02`, `wkds03`, `wkds04`) for `shipto`, `arcupr`, `cuadr`, and `bbshsa1` to store and manipulate record data.
   - **Test Data**: Includes commented-out test values for parameters (e.g., `p$co = '10'`, `p$fcust = '006700'`, etc.).
   - **Environment**: Uses the program status data structure (`psds##`) to access user, date, and time information.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - Applies file overrides for `shipto`, `arcuprrd`, `arcupr`, `cuadrrd`, `cuadr`, `bbshsa1rd`, and `bbshsa` based on `p$fgrp` ('G' for `g*` files, 'Z' for `z*` files) using the `QCMDEXC` API.
   - Opens input files (`arcuprrd`, `cuadrrd`, `bbshsa1rd`) and input/output files (`shipto`, `arcupr`, `cuadr`, `bbshsa`) with `usropn`.

3. **Write New Ship-to Records (`WriteShipto` Subroutine)**:
   - **Copy to `shipto`**:
     - Chains to the source `shipto` record using `klFrmShipto` (`p$co`, `p$fcust`, `p$fshp`).
     - If found (`*in99 = *off`), stores the record in `svds` (save data structure).
     - Checks if the target ship-to exists using `KlToShipto` (`p$co`, `p$tcust`, `p$tshp`).
     - If the target does not exist (`*in99 = *on`):
       - Clears the `shiptopf` record format.
       - Moves `svds` to `wkds01` and updates `csship` (target ship-to) and `cscust` (target customer).
       - Clears specific fields (`cscsid`, `csadr1`, `csadr2`, `csadr3`, `csadr4`, `cszip5`, `cszip9`, `csstat`, `csmils`, `csctst`, `cscszp`, `cslong`, `cslatt`).
       - Writes the new record to `shipto`.
   - **Copy to `arcupr`**:
     - Sets the lower limit (`setll`) for `arcuprrd` using `klFrmShipto`.
     - Reads all matching records (`reade`) until end of file (`*in99 = *on`).
     - For each record found:
       - Stores the record in `svds`.
       - Clears the `arcuprpf` record format.
       - Moves `svds` to `wkds02` and updates `cpship` (target ship-to) and `cpcust` (target customer).
       - Writes the new record to `arcupr`.
   - **Copy to `cuadr`**:
     - Sets the lower limit for `cuadrrd` using `klFrmShipto`.
     - Reads all matching records (`reade`) until end of file.
     - For each record found:
       - Stores the record in `svds`.
       - Clears the `cuadrpf` record format.
       - Moves `svds` to `wkds03` and updates `cdship` (target ship-to) and `cdcust` (target customer).
       - Writes the new record to `cuadr`.
   - **Copy to `bbshsa`**:
     - Sets the lower limit for `bbshsa1rd` using `klFrmShipto`.
     - Reads all matching records (`reade`) until end of file.
     - For each record found:
       - Stores the record in `svds`.
       - Clears the `bbshsapf` record format.
       - Moves `svds` to `wkds04` and updates `baship` (target ship-to), `bacust` (target customer), and `bahkey` (key11).
       - Writes the new record to `bbshsa`.

4. **Program Termination**:
   - Closes all files (`close *all`).
   - Sets `*inlr = *on` and returns.

### Business Rules

1. **Copy Functionality**:
   - Copies ship-to data from a source customer/ship-to (`p$fcust`, `p$fshp`) to a target customer/ship-to (`p$tcust`, `p$tshp`) within the same company (`p$co`).
   - Copies records from `shipto`, `arcupr`, `cuadr`, and `bbshsa1` to their respective target files, updating customer and ship-to fields.

2. **Validation**:
   - Verifies the source ship-to exists in `shipto` using `klFrmShipto`.
   - Ensures the target ship-to does not exist in `shipto` before writing (`*in99 = *on` for `KlToShipto`).
   - No explicit error messages are defined in the code, but the program assumes prior validation (e.g., in `BI890P`) prevents invalid inputs.

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Clears specific fields (`cscsid`, `csadr1`, `csadr2`, `csadr3`, `csadr4`, `cszip5`, `cszip9`, `csstat`, `csmils`, `csctst`, `cscszp`, `cslong`, `cslatt`) in the new `shipto` record to ensure only essential data is copied.
   - Copies all related records from `arcuprrd`, `cuadrrd`, and `bbshsa1rd` without modification, except for updating customer and ship-to fields.

4. **File Overrides**:
   - Uses `p$fgrp` to determine file overrides ('G' for `g*` files, 'Z' for `z*` files).
   - Ensures shared access is disabled (`share(*no)`) to prevent conflicts during writes.

5. **Non-Interactive**:
   - The program is non-interactive, with no display file or user interface (unlike `BI890P` or `BB800E`).
   - It processes data programmatically based on input parameters.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program uses the following database files (tables):
- **Input Files** (with `usropn` and `if` for read-only access, renamed record formats):
  1. **arcuprrd**: Customer pricing read file (`arcuprpf` renamed to `arcuprpr`).
  2. **cuadrrd**: Customer address read file (`cuadrpf` renamed to `cuadrpr`).
  3. **bbshsa1rd**: Ship-to accessorial/marks read file (`bbshsapf` renamed to `bbshsapr`).
- **Input/Output File** (with `usropn` and `uf a` for update/add):
  4. **shipto**: Ship-to master file (supports both reading and writing).
- **Output Files** (with `usropn` and `o` for write-only):
  5. **arcupr**: Customer pricing file (writes new pricing records).
  6. **cuadr**: Customer address file (writes new address records).
  7. **bbshsa**: Ship-to accessorial/marks file (writes new accessorial records).

### External Programs Called

The program calls one external program:
1. **QCMDEXC**: System API to execute file override commands (`ovrdbf`) for `shipto`, `arcuprrd`, `arcupr`, `cuadrrd`, `cuadr`, `bbshsa1rd`, and `bbshsa`.

### Summary

The `BI8903` program is a non-interactive utility that copies ship-to records and related data from a source customer/ship-to to a target customer/ship-to within the same company. It:
- Copies records from `shipto`, `arcuprrd`, `cuadrrd`, and `bbshsa1rd` to `shipto`, `arcupr`, `cuadr`, and `bbshsa`, updating customer and ship-to fields.
- Clears specific `shipto` fields to ensure clean data.
- Uses file overrides based on `p$fgrp` ('G' or 'Z') and ensures no shared access.
- Relies on prior validation (e.g., from `BI890P`) to ensure valid inputs.
- Operates without a user interface, focusing on backend data processing.

The program integrates with seven files and uses the `QCMDEXC` API for file overrides, ensuring efficient data copying for ship-to management in the Brandford Order Entry / Invoices system.
