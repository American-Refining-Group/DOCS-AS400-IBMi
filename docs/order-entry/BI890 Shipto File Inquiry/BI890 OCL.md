The provided document is an OCL (Operation Control Language) program, specifically `BI890.ocl36.txt`, used on IBM AS/400 (iSeries) systems to manage and execute RPG programs. This program, named `BI890`, appears to be a "Ship to Master Inquiry" process, likely used for querying or managing customer shipping information. Below, I will explain the process steps, list the external programs called, and identify the tables (files) used.

### Process Steps of the RPG .OCL Program

OCL is a scripting language used to control the execution of programs and manage file operations on AS/400 systems. The steps in the `BI890.ocl36.txt` program are as follows:

1. **Initial Setup and Program Call**:
   - `CALL STRPCO视角: Calls the `STRPCOCLP` program, which is likely a utility or initialization program to set up the processing environment, possibly handling system-specific configurations or session initialization.
   - `CALL BI890P PARM('?9?' 'INQ')`: Calls the main RPG program `BI890P` with two parameters:
     - `'?9?'`: Likely a placeholder for a library or environment identifier.
     - `'INQ'`: Indicates the program is running in inquiry mode, meaning it is used to retrieve and display data rather than update it.

2. **Conditional Logic** (Commented Out):
   - `// IF ?L'112,3'?/F03 GOTO END`: This line is commented out (inactive). If active, it would check a condition (likely a return code or status at positions 112-114 in a data area or parameter) and branch to the `END` tag if the condition is met, effectively terminating the program early.

3. **Local Offset Specification**:
   - `// LOCAL OFFSET-480,DATA-'?9?'`: Defines a local data area with an offset of 480 bytes, initialized with the value `'?9?'`. This is likely used to store temporary data or parameters specific to the library or environment during execution.

4. **File Declarations**:
   - The program declares multiple files (tables) to be loaded with shared access (`DISP-SHR`). These files are used by the RPG program `BI890P` or other called programs for reading data:
     - `SHIPTO`: Contains ship-to address or customer data.
     - `ARCUST`: Stores customer master data.
     - `ARCUPR`: Holds customer pricing information.
     - `BICONT`: Contains contract or agreement data.
     - `GSPROD`: Stores product master data.
     - `GSTABL`: General system table for reference data.
     - `TRRTCD`: Contains territory or region codes.
     - `CUADR` and `CUADRRD`: Customer address data (used by `BI9002`).
     - `BBORA1`, `BBORDH`, `BBSHSA1`: Order-related files (used by `BB800E`).
     - `SHIPTHS`, `ARCUPHS`: Historical ship-to and customer pricing data.

5. **Program Execution**:
   - `// RUN`: Executes the `BI890P` program, which uses the loaded files to perform the inquiry process, likely retrieving and displaying ship-to master data based on user input or parameters.

6. **Loop Control** (Commented Out):
   - `// GOTO AGAIN`: This line is commented out. If active, it would loop back to the `AGAIN` tag, potentially allowing the program to repeat the inquiry process. Since it’s commented out, the program executes once and proceeds to the `END` tag.

7. **Program Termination**:
   - `// TAG END`: Marks the end of the program, where execution terminates after completing the inquiry process.

### External Programs Called

The OCL program explicitly calls the following external programs:
1. **STRPCOCLP**: A utility program, likely for initializing the environment or session, setting up system parameters, or preparing the runtime context.
2. **BI890P**: The main RPG program responsible for the ship-to master inquiry logic, using the provided parameters (`'?9?'` and `'INQ'`) to query data.
3. **BI9002**: Referenced in the file declarations for `CUADR` and `CUADRRD`, indicating it is called by `BI890P` to handle customer address-related processing.
4. **BB800E**: Referenced in the file declarations for `BBORA1`, `BBORDH`, and `BBSHSA1`, indicating it is called to process order-related data.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program declares the following files (tables) with shared access (`DISP-SHR`):
1. **SHIPTO**: Ship-to master data (customer shipping addresses or locations).
2. **ARCUST**: Customer master file (core customer information).
3. **ARCUPR**: Customer pricing data.
4. **BICONT**: Contract or agreement details.
5. **GSPROD**: Product master data.
6. **GSTABL**: General system table (lookup or reference data).
7. **TRRTCD**: Territory or region codes.
8. **CUADR**: Customer address file (used by `BI9002`).
9. **CUADRRD**: Likely a redundant or alternate name for `CUADR` (used by `BI9002`).
10. **BBORA1**: Order-related data (used by `BB800E`).
11. **BBORDH**: Order header data (used by `BB800E`).
12. **BBSHSA1**: Ship-to sales analysis data (used by `BB800E`).
13. **SHIPTHS**: Historical ship-to data.
14. **ARCUPHS**: Historical customer pricing data.

### Summary

The `BI890.ocl36.txt` OCL program orchestrates a ship-to master inquiry process by:
- Initializing the environment with `STRPCOCLP`.
- Calling the main RPG program `BI890P` in inquiry mode to retrieve and display data.
- Loading multiple files (tables) for customer, product, order, and historical data access.
- Optionally calling `BI9002` for address processing and `BB800E` for order processing.
- Using shared file access to ensure data integrity during execution.

The program is designed to query and display ship-to master data, leveraging a robust set of files and external programs to handle related customer and order information. Some control statements are commented out, suggesting flexibility in the program’s flow that is currently disabled.
