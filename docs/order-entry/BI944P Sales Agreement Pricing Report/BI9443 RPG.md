The RPG program `BI9443.rpg` is an RPG/400 program called by the OCL program `BI944.ocl36.txt` to update the Customer Sales Agreement file (`BICUAG`) by adding salesman, product class, and division information, producing an output file (`BICUAGNW`). It includes logic to filter out expired agreements based on their end dates. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and any external programs called.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

The program processes records from the `BICUAG` file, validates them against reference files (`ARCUST`, `GSPROD`, `GSTABL`), and writes updated records to `BICUAGNW` with additional fields (salesman, product class, division). The steps are as follows:

1. **File and Record Initialization** (Lines 0004–0058):
   - **Input Files**:
     - `BICUAG` (Primary Input, 256 bytes, disk): Primary file containing sales agreement records.
     - `GSTABL` (Input, 256 bytes, indexed): General system table for product class and division data.
     - `ARCUST` (Input, 384 bytes, indexed): Customer master file for salesman data.
     - `GSPROD` (Input, 512 bytes, indexed): Product master file for product class validation (added in revision JK01).
   - **Output File**:
     - `BICUAGNW` (Output, 263 bytes, disk): Output file with updated records, including new fields.
   - **Input Specifications**:
     - `BICUAG`: Defines fields like `BACONO` (company, positions 2–3), `BACOCU` (company/customer, 2–9), `BACUST` (customer number, 4–9), `BAPR01` (product code, 13–16), and `BAEND8` (end date in CYMD format, 126–133).
     - `GSTABL`: Defines fields like `TBDESC` (table description, 14–43), `TBDES2` (alternate description, 22–43), `TBPRCL` (product class code, 127–129), and `TBCSRT` (inventory company sort, 178–179).
     - `ARCUST`: Defines fields like `ARDEL` (delete code, 1–1) and `ARSLS#` (salesman number, 263–264).
     - `GSPROD`: Defines fields like `TPDEL` (delete flag, 1–1), `TPDESC` (description, 14–43), `TPDES1` (complete description, 14–33), `TPPRGP` (product group code, 89–90), `TPPRCL` (product class code, 127–129), `TPABDS` (short description, 145–154), and `TPFLCD` (252–252).
     - `UDS` (User Data Structure): Defines `KYDAT8` (system date in CYMD format, 333–340) for date comparison.

2. **Main Processing Loop** (Lines 0015–0016, C-specs):
   - **Record Processing** (Indicator 01, primary file `BICUAG`):
     - Reads each record from `BICUAG` sequentially.
     - Initializes indicator 50 to off (`SETOF 50`).
   - **End Date Validation (JB01)**:
     - Checks if `BAEND8` (end date in CYMD format) is non-zero.
     - If non-zero and less than `KYDAT8` (system date), skips to `ENDIT` (omits expired agreements).
     - If `BAEND8` is zero (no end date), sets indicator 50 on to include the record.
   - **Customer Lookup**:
     - Chains to `ARCUST` using `BACOCU` (company/customer key, positions 2–9).
     - If found (indicator 99 off), moves `ARSLS#` (salesman number) to `SLSMAN` (2-byte field).
   - **Product Class Lookup (JK01)**:
     - Builds a key `KLPROD` (6 bytes) by combining `BACONO` (company) and `BAPR01` (product code).
     - Chains to `GSPROD` using `KLPROD` to retrieve the product class.
     - If found (indicator 65 off), moves `TPPRCL` (product class code) to `PRCL` (3 bytes).
     - If not found, builds a key `PRCLKY` (12 bytes) by combining `'PRODCL'` and `KEY5` (company + `PRCL`), then chains to `GSTABL`.
     - If found in `GSTABL` (indicator 65 off), moves `TBCSRT` (inventory company sort) to `DIV` (2 bytes) and writes the record (`EXCPT PRODCL`).
   - **Output**:
     - Writes to `BICUAGNW` using the `PRODCL` format:
       - `RECORD` (entire input record, positions 1–256).
       - If indicator 50 is on, writes `'791231'` to positions 70–75 and `'20791231'` to positions 128–133 (likely default dates for unexpired agreements).
       - `DIV` (division, position 258).
       - `PRCL` (product class, 259–261).
       - `SLSMAN` (salesman number, 262–263, blank-filled).

3. **End of Processing**:
   - Branches to `ENDIT` for skipped records (expired agreements).
   - Continues reading `BICUAG` until end-of-file, processing each valid record.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules:
1. **Include Only Unexpired Agreements (JB01)**:
   - Agreements with a non-zero end date (`BAEND8`) must be greater than or equal to the system date (`KYDAT8`) to be included.
   - Agreements with a zero end date (`BAEND8 = *ZEROS`) are included as unexpired, with default dates `'791231'` and `'20791231'` written to the output.
2. **Customer Validation**:
   - The customer number (`BACOCU`) must exist in `ARCUST` (indicator 99 off) to retrieve the salesman number (`ARSLS#`).
3. **Product Class Validation (JK01)**:
   - The product code (`BAPR01` + `BACONO`) is first validated against `GSPROD` to retrieve the product class (`TPPRCL`).
   - If not found in `GSPROD`, the product class (`PRCL`) is validated against `GSTABL` using the `PRODCL` key to retrieve the division (`TBCSRT`).
4. **Output Record Structure**:
   - The output record includes the original `BICUAG` record (1–256), division (258), product class (259–261), and salesman number (262–263).
   - For unexpired agreements with zero end dates, specific date fields are populated with default values.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program uses the following files, as defined in the File Specification (F-spec) and Input Specification (I-spec):
1. **BICUAG** (Primary Input, 256 bytes):
   - Fields: `BACONO` (company), `BACOCU` (company/customer), `BACUST` (customer number), `BAPR01` (product code), `BAEND8` (end date).
   - Usage: Primary input file containing sales agreement records.
2. **GSTABL** (Input, 256 bytes, indexed):
   - Fields: `TBDESC`, `TBDES2`, `TBPRCL` (product class code), `TBCSRT` (division sort code).
   - Usage: Chained to validate product class and retrieve division.
3. **ARCUST** (Input, 384 bytes, indexed):
   - Fields: `ARDEL` (delete code), `ARSLS#` (salesman number).
   - Usage: Chained to retrieve salesman number for the customer.
4. **GSPROD** (Input, 512 bytes, indexed):
   - Fields: `TPDEL`, `TPDESC`, `TPDES1`, `TPPRGP`, `TPPRCL`, `TPABDS`, `TPFLCD`.
   - Usage: Chained to validate product code and retrieve product class.
5. **BICUAGNW** (Output, 263 bytes):
   - Fields: `RECORD` (1–256), `DIV` (258), `PRCL` (259–261), `SLSMAN` (262–263), and default dates (70–75, 128–133 when indicator 50 is on).
   - Usage: Output file with updated sales agreement records.

### External Programs Called

The RPG program `BI9443` does not explicitly call any external programs via `CALL` operations. It is invoked by the OCL program `BI944.ocl36.txt` and processes data independently, writing to `BICUAGNW` for subsequent steps in the OCL workflow (e.g., sorting by `#GSORT` or further processing by `BI9444` and `BI944`).

### Summary

- **Process Steps**:
  1. Read each record from `BICUAG`.
  2. Validate the end date (`BAEND8`):
     - Skip if non-zero and less than `KYDAT8` (expired).
     - Include if zero, setting indicator 50 and default dates.
  3. Chain to `ARCUST` to retrieve salesman number (`ARSLS#`).
  4. Chain to `GSPROD` to retrieve product class (`TPPRCL`); if not found, chain to `GSTABL` to validate product class and retrieve division (`TBCSRT`).
  5. Write updated record to `BICUAGNW` with original data, division, product class, salesman, and default dates (if applicable).
  6. Continue until all `BICUAG` records are processed.

- **Business Rules**:
  - Include only unexpired agreements (end date ≥ system date or zero).
  - Validate customer number against `ARCUST` to get salesman number.
  - Validate product code against `GSPROD` for product class; fall back to `GSTABL` if needed.
  - Output includes original record plus division, product class, salesman, and default dates for zero-end-date records.

- **Tables Used**:
  - `BICUAG` (primary input)
  - `GSTABL` (input, indexed)
  - `ARCUST` (input, indexed)
  - `GSPROD` (input, indexed)
  - `BICUAGNW` (output)

- **External Programs Called**:
  - None directly called within the RPG program. It is part of the OCL workflow involving `BI9444`, `#GSORT`, and `BI944`.

This program prepares sales agreement data by appending critical fields (salesman, product class, division) and filtering out expired agreements, setting the stage for sorting and final report generation in the OCL process.
