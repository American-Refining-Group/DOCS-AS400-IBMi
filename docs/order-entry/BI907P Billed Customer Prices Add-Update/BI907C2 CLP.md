The `BI907C2` CLP (Control Language Program) is a simple program within the Bradford Order Entry/Invoices system, called from the main RPGLE program `BI907P`. Its primary function is to clear a temporary work file used by other programs in the system. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the BI907C2 CLP Program

The `BI907C2` program is straightforward and performs a single operation:

1. **Clear Work File**:
   - Executes the `CLRPFM` (Clear Physical File Member) command to clear all records from the `BI907W` file in the `QTEMP` library.
   - The `QTEMP` library is a job-specific temporary library, ensuring that the file is unique to the current job and does not affect other users or jobs.

2. **Program Termination**:
   - The program ends with the `ENDPGM` command, returning control to the calling program (e.g., `BI907P`).

### Business Rules

The `BI907C2` program enforces the following business rules:

1. **Temporary File Management**:
   - The program ensures that the `BI907W` file in `QTEMP` is cleared of all records before it is used by other programs in the system.
   - This prevents residual data from previous operations from affecting subsequent processes, ensuring a clean slate for temporary data storage.

2. **No Error Handling**:
   - The program does not include explicit error handling (e.g., `MONMSG` for `CPF3142` if the file does not exist).
   - It assumes that the `BI907W` file exists in `QTEMP`, as it is likely created by another program (e.g., `BI907C`) before `BI907C2` is called.
   - If the file does not exist, the `CLRPFM` command will fail, and the error will propagate to the calling program unless handled elsewhere.

3. **Context Dependency**:
   - The program is designed to be called as part of a larger workflow, likely from `BI907P`, to prepare the `BI907W` file for use in customer/ship-to file maintenance or inquiry processes.
   - It does not accept parameters, implying that it operates on a predefined file (`BI907W` in `QTEMP`).

### Tables Used

The `BI907C2` program interacts with the following table:
1. **BI907W**:
   - Library: `QTEMP`.
   - Purpose: Temporary work file used for processing customer/ship-to data in the Bradford Order Entry/Invoices system.
   - Operation: Cleared using the `CLRPFM` command to remove all records.
   - Access: Write (implicitly via `CLRPFM`).

No other database files are directly referenced in `BI907C2`.

### External Programs Called

The `BI907C2` program does not call any external programs. It executes a single system command (`CLRPFM`) and terminates.

---

### Summary

The `BI907C2` CLP program is a minimal utility designed to clear the `BI907W` temporary work file in the `QTEMP` library. It ensures that no residual data remains in the file before it is used by other programs (e.g., `BI907` or `BI9078`) in the customer/ship-to file maintenance or inquiry process. The program enforces a simple business rule of maintaining a clean temporary file but lacks explicit error handling, relying on the calling program or prior setup (e.g., by `BI907C`) to ensure the file exists. It interacts solely with the `BI907W` file and does not call any external programs, making it a lightweight component of the broader system workflow.
