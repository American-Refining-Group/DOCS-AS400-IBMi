The provided document is an RPGLE program named `BB955.rpgle`, which is called from the OCL program `BB955.ocl36.txt` for "Rack Price File Maintenance" in the Bradford Order Entry / Invoices system. Below, Iâ€™ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called based on the provided RPGLE code. Since the code is truncated, the analysis covers the available portion, focusing on the main program flow, subroutines, and key logic.

### Process Steps of the RPGLE Program

The `BB955` program is an interactive RPGLE program that maintains rack price data, allowing users to view, update, add, or delete pricing records via a subfile-based display. It uses a workstation file (`bb955d`) for user interaction and manages data in a work file (`bb955w`) and primary price file (`bbprce`). The program follows these high-level steps:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - **Open Database Tables**: The subroutine `opntbl` is executed to open the necessary files (`bb955d`, `bicont`, `gscntr1`, `gsctum`, `gsprod`, `gstabl`, `inloc`, `bbprcw`, `bb955w`, `bbprce`, `bbprceh`). These files are opened with the `USROPN` keyword, indicating they are explicitly opened by the program.
   - **Retrieve Initial Data**: The `rtvdta` subroutine retrieves data based on the parameter passed from the OCL program (`'?9?'`), likely initializing key fields or setting up the environment.
   - **Subfile Processing**: The main logic is handled by the `srsfl1` subroutine, which manages the subfile (`sfl1`) for displaying and editing rack price records.

2. **Subfile Processing (`srsfl1` Subroutine)**:
   - **Initialize Subfile**: The subfile is set to "folded" mode (`sfmod1 = '1'`, `*IN45 = *ON`), controlling how data is displayed (folded or unfolded). The message subfile is cleared (`clrmsg`), and function key labels are set (`s1f06d`, `s1f08d`).
   - **Main Loop (`sf1agn`)**: The program enters a loop to handle user interaction:
     - **Reposition Subfile**: If the `repsfl` flag is set, the `sf1rep` subroutine repositions the subfile based on user filters (e.g., company number, location, product).
     - **Condition Function Keys**: The program checks for subfile records (`rrn1`) to enable/disable function keys (e.g., F7 for accepting changes, `*IN78`).
     - **Display Subfile**: The subfile control record (`sflctl1`) is displayed using `EXFMT`, allowing user input. The subfile display is conditioned (`*IN41`) based on whether records exist.
     - **Handle Folded/Unfolded Mode**: The display toggles between folded (`*IN45 = *OFF`) and unfolded modes based on `sfmod1` and whether multiple quantities exist (`w$mltqty`).
     - **Cursor Positioning**: The cursor is positioned to the effective date field for new records (`*IN77`) if no errors are present.
   - **Process User Input**:
     - **F3 (Exit)**: Exits the loop (`sf1agn = *OFF`).
     - **F4 (Prompt)**: Calls the `prompt` subroutine to assist with field input.
     - **F5 (Refresh)**: Triggers subfile repositioning (`repsfl = *ON`).
     - **F6 (Toggle Update)**: Toggles whether existing records can be updated (`s1alwupd`), updating the function key label (`s1f06d`).
     - **F8 (Toggle Deleted Records)**: Toggles whether deleted records are shown (`s1showdel`), updating the function key label (`s1f08d`).
     - **F9 (History Inquiry)**: Calls the external program `GB730P` with parameters (`x$custhist`) to display historical data for the selected subfile record.
     - **F10 (Position Cursor)**: Clears cursor coordinates (`row1`, `col1`) to reposition to the control record.
     - **F23 (Delete/Restore)**: Processes deletion or restoration of a subfile record (`sf1del`, `sf1fmt`, `sf1pro`), updates the subfile, and sets `SFLNXTCHG` (`*IN44`).
     - **User Filters**: If control fields (e.g., `c1cono`, `c1loc`, `c1prod`) differ from saved values, the subfile is repositioned (`sf1rep`).
     - **New Record Input**: If the effective date (`c1emdy`) or location fields (`loc`) change, the `sf1ctenew` subroutine validates new record input.
     - **Enter/F7 (Accept Changes)**: Processes subfile changes (`sf1prc`) or accepts changes (`sf1f07`) if no errors are present (`w$sflerr = *OFF`).

3. **Subfile Record Processing (`sf1prc` Subroutine)**:
   - Reads changed subfile records (`READC sfl1`) and processes them via `sf1chg`.
   - Sets the `s1chng` flag to indicate changes and checks for errors (`w$sflerr`).

4. **Process Subfile Changes (`sf1chg` Subroutine)**:
   - Edits subfile input (`sf1edt`) to validate fields.
   - Updates the database (`sf1upd`) if no errors are present (`*IN50 = *OFF`).

5. **Update Database (`sf1upd` Subroutine)**:
   - Chains to the work file (`bb955w`) using key fields (`klsfl1`).
   - Updates existing fields (`w1prce`, `w1pr02`, etc.) and new fields (`n1prce`, `n1pr02`, etc.) in the work file.
   - Copies data to history fields (`h1prce`, `h1pr01`) for logging.

6. **Accept Changes (`sf1f07` Subroutine)**:
   - Checks for new records in the work file (`bb955w`) by scanning for non-zero/non-blank values (`n1minq`, `n1rkrq`, etc.).
   - Validates the effective date (`c1emdy`) for new records, displaying an error (`ERR0020`) if missing.
   - Displays a confirmation window (`f07wrn`) and processes user input:
     - **F12**: Cancels the update (`winagn = *OFF`).
     - **F22**: Triggers the database update (`sf1f07upd`).
   - Clears the subfile and work file, calls `BB955AC` to recreate the work file, and resets filters.

7. **Update Database for F7 (`sf1f07upd` Subroutine)**:
   - Reads the work file (`bb955w`) and skips records marked as deleted (`w1del = 'D'`).
   - Updates existing records in `bbprce` by comparing fields (`w1prce` vs. `rkprce`, etc.) and writing changes if differences exist. Calls `writehist` to log changes to `bbprceh`.
   - Adds new records for the new effective date (`c1edat`) if non-zero/non-blank values exist. Restores deleted records (`rkdel = 'A'`) if applicable.
   - Calls `updadlloc` and `addadlloc` to handle additional locations.

8. **Update Additional Locations (`updadlloc` Subroutine)**:
   - Loops through 10 additional locations (`loc` array).
   - Updates existing records in `bbprce` for each non-blank location, comparing and updating fields as needed. Logs changes via `writehist`.

9. **Add Additional Locations (`addadlloc` Subroutine)**:
   - Loops through 10 additional locations (`loc` array).
   - Adds new records to `bbprce` for non-blank locations with the new effective date (`c1edat`). Logs changes via `writehist`.

10. **Reposition Subfile (`sf1rep` Subroutine)**:
    - Checks if user filters have changed (e.g., `c1cono` vs. `r$cono`).
    - If the work file is open and contains records, warns the user of unprocessed changes (`bldwrkfwrn`).
    - Clears the subfile (`sf1clr`), validates control fields (`sf1cte`), rebuilds the work file (`bldwrkf`) if needed, and loads all records (`sf1lodall`).

11. **Program Termination**:
    - Closes all files (`CLOSE *ALL`).
    - Sets `*INLR = *ON` to indicate the program is complete and returns control to the calling OCL program.

### Business Rules

The program enforces several business rules for maintaining rack price data:
- **Display Validation**: The OCL program checks for a `27X132` display condition, and if present, prevents execution, indicating a compatibility issue.
- **Subfile Management**: The subfile supports viewing, updating, adding, and deleting records. Users can toggle between showing/hiding deleted records (`s1showdel`) and allowing/preventing updates to existing records (`s1alwupd`).
- **Data Validation**: Input fields (e.g., quantities `s1qt`, prices `s1pr`, new quantities `n$qt`, new prices `n$pr`) are validated (`sf1edt`, `sf1ctenew`) to ensure data integrity.
- **Effective Date Requirement**: New records require a valid effective date (`c1emdy`). If missing, an error (`ERR0020`) is displayed.
- **History Logging**: Changes to `bbprce` are logged to `bbprceh` via the `writehist` subroutine (added in revision `JK01`).
- **Additional Locations**: The program supports up to 10 additional locations (`loc` array), updating or adding records for each non-blank location.
- **Deleted Records**: Records marked as deleted (`rkdel = 'D'`) can be restored (`rkdel = 'A'`) or excluded based on the `s1showdel` toggle. Inactive records in `gsctum`, `gsctwt`, and `gsumcv` are treated as deleted (revision `JB05`).
- **Work File Management**: The work file (`bb955w`) is recreated via `BB955AC` and cleared after updates to ensure data consistency.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are displayed in a message subfile (`m@msgf = 'GSMSGF'`), with indicators (`*IN50` to `*IN69`) flagging specific field errors.
- **Currency**: The program assumes prices are in U.S. dollars (`c#US$ = 'U.S. Dollars'`).

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files (tables), as defined in the file specifications:
1. **bb955d**: Workstation file (display file) with a subfile (`sfl1`) for user interaction. Used for input/output via the display.
2. **bicont**: Input-only file, likely containing control or configuration data.
3. **gscntr1**: Input-only file, used for country or center data (replaced `gscntr` in revision `JK03` for an alpha key).
4. **gsctum**: Input-only file, possibly containing customer or unit master data (treated as deleted if inactive, per `JB05`).
5. **gsprod**: Input-only file, containing product master data.
6. **gstabl**: Input-only file, likely a general table for reference data.
7. **inloc**: Input-only file, containing location data.
8. **bbprcw**: Input-only file, a renamed version of `bbprcepf` (`bbprcepw`) for reading price data.
9. **bb955w**: Update file (work file) in `QTEMP` (revision `jk04`), used to stage changes before updating the main price file.
10. **bbprce**: Update file, the primary file for rack price data.
11. **bbprceh**: Output file, used to log historical price changes (added in revision `JK01`).

### External Programs Called

The program calls the following external programs:
1. **GB730P**: Called when the F9 key is pressed to display historical data for a selected subfile record. Parameters are passed via the `x$custhist` data structure.
2. **BB955AC**: Called to create or clear the work file (`bb955w`) after updates, passing the file group parameter (`p$fgrp` to `o$fgrp`).

### Additional Notes

- **Truncated Code**: The provided code is truncated, omitting subroutines like `opntbl`, `rtvdta`, `sf1edt`, `sf1del`, `sf1fmt`, `sf1pro`, `sf1cte`, `sf1lodall`, `bldwrkf`, `bldwrkfwrn`, `clrmsg`, `wrtmsg`, `addmsg`, and `writehist`. These likely handle specific tasks like file opening, data retrieval, validation, deletion logic, and history logging. If you have the full code, I can provide a more detailed analysis.
- **Revisions**: The program has been updated to add history logging (`JK01`), fix a company number field issue (`JB02`), update timestamps (`JK02`), switch to `gscntr1` (`JK03`), handle inactive records (`JB05`), and override `bb955w` to `QTEMP` (`jk04`).
- **Subfile Design**: The subfile (`sfl1`) supports up to four quantity/price pairs (`s1qt`, `s1pr`, `n$qt`, `n$pr`) and additional locations (`loc`), with fields for company number, product, country, unit of measure, effective date, and more.
- **Parameter from OCL**: The `'?9?'` parameter from the OCL program is not explicitly referenced in the provided code but likely influences the `rtvdta` subroutineâ€™s behavior.
