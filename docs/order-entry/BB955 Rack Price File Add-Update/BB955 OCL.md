### Process Steps of the OCL Program

This OCL (Operations Control Language) program appears to be a procedure script (likely from an IBM System/36 or AS/400 compatibility environment) designed to handle "Rack Price File Maintenance." It performs conditional checks before invoking external programs. The steps are executed sequentially as follows:

1. **Procedure Parameter Setup**: The program begins with `// SCPROCP ,,,,,,,,?9?`, which likely defines or sets up the procedure with a parameter placeholder `?9?`. In OCL syntax, this could be configuring the 9th parameter position for input, allowing the procedure to accept a runtime value (e.g., a mode or option flag).

2. **Display Mode Check and Error Handling**:
   - It uses conditional `IFF` (If) statements to evaluate the display mode: `IFF DSPLY-27X132`.
   - If the terminal/display is in 27x132 mode (a wide-screen format), it executes:
     - Displays an error message: `* 'RACK PRICE CANNOT BE RUN.  SUBMIT I.T. HELP TICKET FOR THE 27X132 FIX'`.
     - Pauses execution (`PAUSE`) to allow the user to read the message.
     - Returns control (`RETURN`), effectively exiting the procedure without further processing.
   - This acts as a safeguard to prevent running the maintenance in an incompatible display mode.

3. **Comment Block**: A comment section `** RACK PRICE FILE MAINTENANCE` provides a description of the procedure's purpose, but performs no executable action.

4. **Execute GSY2K**: If the display check passes (i.e., not 27x132 mode), it runs `// GSY2K`. This is likely a command or utility program, possibly related to globalization, date handling, or Y2K compliance (common in legacy systems), to prepare the environment.

5. **Call Main Program**: Finally, it invokes `// CALL BB955 PARM('?9?')`, which calls the external program `BB955` (presumably an RPG program for the actual file maintenance logic) and passes the value of the parameter `?9?` to it.

The overall flow ensures compatibility checks before proceeding to the core maintenance task. If the display is incompatible, the process aborts early; otherwise, it sets up the environment and calls the main logic.

### External Programs Called
- `GSY2K`: Executed as a preparatory step, likely a utility or command (purpose inferred as environment setup, e.g., for date/year handling).
- `BB955`: The primary program called with a parameter, handling the "Rack Price File Maintenance" functionality (assumed to be an RPG program based on context).

### Tables Used
No tables (files or database objects) are explicitly referenced or used in this OCL program. Any table access would occur within the called programs (e.g., `BB955`), but none are declared here.
