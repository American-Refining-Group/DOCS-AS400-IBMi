### List of Use Cases

Based on the OCL script and RPG program AR991P, the call stack implements the following use cases for managing Accounts Receivable (A/R) override codes in a legacy IBM midrange system. These are derived from the program's logic for code generation, storage, display, and conditional handling:

1. **Generate Unique A/R Override Code**: The primary use case involves creating a time-based unique 6-digit numeric code for overriding A/R processes (e.g., credit approvals or transaction bypasses), ensuring uniqueness via system date/time calculations.

2. **Store and Log Override Code**: If a control record is not found in the database, add a new record to persist the generated code for auditing, tracking, or future retrieval, including status flags.

3. **Display Override Code to User**: Prompt and output the generated code and any messages via a workstation screen for user interaction in A/R workflows.

4. **Handle Cancellation or Early Termination**: Check for cancellation conditions post-execution and signal back (e.g., via 'CANCEL' flag) to abort or override the process, integrating with job control.

5. **Y2K-Compliant Date Handling**: Convert and manipulate dates to ensure compatibility in code generation, preventing millennium-related errors in financial overrides.

6. **Conditional Program Execution**: Initialize environment, check indicators, and skip processing if not in a valid state (e.g., based on input indicators), ensuring secure invocation only from authorized contexts like the OCL wrapper.

These use cases support secure, auditable A/R overrides, with the main flow centered on code generation and ancillary ones handling errors, logging, and user interaction.

### Function Requirement Document

#### Function Overview
**Function Name**: GenerateAROverrideCode  
**Purpose**: Generate, store, and return a unique 6-digit A/R override code based on current system date/time, without screen interaction. This function acts as a non-interactive wrapper for the use cases, taking inputs (e.g., dynamic file parameter) and returning the code or status. It enforces business rules for uniqueness, auditing, and cancellation in A/R workflows.

**Inputs**:  
- Dynamic file parameter (string, e.g., prefix for GSCONT file name).  
- Current system date/time (automatically retrieved; for testing, injectable as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).  
- Optional cancellation flag (boolean; defaults to false).  

**Outputs**:  
- Override code (6-digit numeric string).  
- Status message (string, e.g., "Success", "Canceled", or error).  
- Updated database record if added.

**Assumptions**:  
- Replaces interactive SCREEN file with direct input/output.  
- Uses GSCONT table for storage/retrieval.  
- Invoked in a controlled environment (e.g., from OCL-like script).

#### Process Steps
1. **Initialize Environment**: Reset variables and retrieve current system date/time. Load/override GSCONT file using dynamic parameter (e.g., construct file name as [parameter]GSCONT).

2. **Generate Unique Code**:  
   - Extract date (SYSDAT, 6 digits, MMDDYY) and time (SYSTIM, 6 digits, HHMMSS).  
   - Convert date to YYMMDD format (SYSYMD) via multiplication by 10000.01.  
   - Prefix '20' to create 8-digit date (SYSDT8, e.g., 20YYMMDD for Y2K compliance).  
   - Add time to date for FLD1 (8 digits).  
   - Multiply FLD1 by SYSYMD for FLD2 (11 digits).  
   - Truncate/convert FLD2 to 6-digit KYCODE via zero-add.

3. **Check and Store in Database**:  
   - Keyed read (chain) GSCONT with dummy key '00' to check for control record.  
   - If not found, add new record with KYCODE in positions 59-64, and set deletion/status flag (GCDEL) to default (e.g., active).

4. **Handle Cancellation**:  
   - If cancellation flag is true or indicator condition met (e.g., equivalent to KG on), set status to 'CANCEL' and return without storing.

5. **Return Results**: Output KYCODE and status; close resources.

#### Business Rules
- **Uniqueness and Timeliness**: KYCODE must be derived from current timestamp to ensure non-reusable, time-bound overrides (e.g., expires implicitly after use in A/R transactions). Prevents duplicate approvals in financial systems.
- **Auditing Requirement**: Always log new codes in GSCONT for traceability; include status flag to mark deletions or invalidations.
- **Y2K Compliance**: Mandate '20' prefix for dates to handle two-digit year formats, ensuring codes generated post-2000 are valid.
- **Cancellation Override**: If flagged, abort and signal 'CANCEL' to caller, blocking unauthorized or interrupted A/R overrides.
- **Error Handling**: On missing record, create new one; on other failures (e.g., file access), return error status without code.
- **Security**: Function must only run in valid contexts (e.g., check initial indicators); codes are numeric and limited to 6 digits for simplicity in A/R entry.
