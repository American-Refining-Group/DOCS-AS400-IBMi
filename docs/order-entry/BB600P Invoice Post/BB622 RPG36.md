The `BB622.rpg36.txt` RPG program is a simple program called by the main OCL program (likely `BB600.ocl36.txt`) within the invoice posting workflow on an IBM System/36 environment. Its primary function is to copy records from the input file `CFIFILE` to the output file `CF0E020`, effectively adding records to a file used for further processing in the Customer Freight Invoice (CFI) system. The program is straightforward, with minimal logic, and does not include any revisions or complex processing. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the BB622 RPG Program

The `BB622` program reads records from `CFIFILE` and writes them to `CF0E020` using the RPG cycle, with no transformations or validations.

1. **File Initialization**:
   - The program opens two files:
     - **Input File**:
       - `CFIFILE`: Primary input file (`IP`), 80 bytes per record, disk-based. Contains customer freight invoice records.
     - **Output File**:
       - `CF0E020`: Output file (`O`), 80 bytes per record, add capability (`A`), disk-based. Receives copied records.
   - Defines a record format for `CFIFILE`:
     - `RECORD`: Single field (positions 1–80) containing the entire record.

2. **Record Processing**:
   - Reads each record from `CFIFILE` sequentially using the RPG cycle (`NS 01`).
   - For each record, executes an exception output operation (`EXCPTRECADD`) to write to `CF0E020`.

3. **Output Processing**:
   - Writes the entire `RECORD` field (80 bytes) to `CF0E020` using the `EADD RECADD` specification.
   - No modifications or validations are performed on the record data.

4. **Cycle Completion**:
   - Processes all records in `CFIFILE` until the end of the file.
   - Closes all files and terminates.

### Business Rules

1. **Direct Record Copy**:
   - Copies all records from `CFIFILE` to `CF0E020` without modification.
   - Assumes all records in `CFIFILE` are valid and suitable for output.

2. **No Validation or Filtering**:
   - Does not check record content, transaction types, or dates.
   - All records are written to `CF0E020` as-is.

3. **Integration with CFI System**:
   - Adds records to `CF0E020`, which is likely used in the Customer Freight Invoice system for further processing or reporting.

4. **No Error Handling**:
   - Assumes `CFIFILE` exists and contains valid data, and `CF0E020` can be written to without issues.
   - No explicit error handling for file access or write failures.

5. **Simple Workflow**:
   - Designed as a straightforward data transfer program within the invoice posting workflow.

### Tables (Files) Used

1. **CFIFILE**:
   - **Description**: Customer freight invoice input file.
   - **Attributes**: 80 bytes per record, primary input file (`IP`), disk-based.
   - **Fields Used**:
     - `RECORD` (1–80): Entire record content.
   - **Purpose**: Contains freight invoice records to be copied.
   - **Usage**: Read sequentially to process records.

2. **CF0E020**:
   - **Description**: Customer freight invoice output file.
   - **Attributes**: 80 bytes per record, output file (`O`), add capability (`A`), disk-based.
   - **Fields Used**:
     - `RECORD` (1–80): Entire record content.
   - **Purpose**: Receives copied freight invoice records.
   - **Usage**: Written with `EADD RECADD`.

### External Programs Called

The `BB622` RPG program does not call any external programs. It is a self-contained program that performs a simple copy operation from `CFIFILE` to `CF0E020`.

### Summary

The `BB622` RPG program, called by the main OCL (e.g., `BB600.ocl36.txt`), performs a basic task in the invoice posting workflow by:
- Reading records from `CFIFILE` (80 bytes) sequentially.
- Writing each record to `CF0E020` without modification using an exception output operation.
- Terminating after processing all records.

**Tables Used**: `CFIFILE` (input freight invoice records), `CF0E020` (output freight invoice records).
**External Programs Called**: None.

This program supports the Customer Freight Invoice system by transferring records to a file for further processing, with minimal logic and no data transformation.
