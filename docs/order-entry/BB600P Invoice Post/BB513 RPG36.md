The RPG program `BB513.rpg36.txt` is a simple program designed to copy records from a temporary EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) work file to a permanent file for transmission to a third-party service, Kleinschmidt. It is likely called by an OCL program within the invoice posting workflow (related to `BB600P.ocl36.txt`). Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the BB513 RPG Program

The `BB513` program is a straightforward RPG program that performs a single task: reading records from the `EDIOUT` file and writing them to the `EDI810` file. It operates in a sequential manner, processing each record without modification.

#### Process Steps:
1. **File Initialization**:
   - The program opens two files:
     - `EDIOUT`: Input file, defined as the primary input file (`IP`), containing temporary EDI records.
     - `EDI810`: Output file, defined for output (`O`) with add capability (`A`), used to store permanent EDI records.
   - Both files are fixed-length (128 bytes per record) and disk-based.

2. **Record Processing**:
   - The program reads each record from `EDIOUT` sequentially (`NS 01` indicates non-sequential input, but as the primary file, it is processed in the RPG cycle).
   - For each record read, the entire 128-byte record (`RECORD` field, positions 1–128) is moved to the output file `EDI810`.
   - The output specification (`OEDI810 DADD 01`) writes the `RECORD` field to `EDI810` using an add operation (`DADD`), creating a new record in the output file.

3. **Cycle Completion**:
   - The RPG program uses the standard RPG cycle to process all records in `EDIOUT` until the end of the file is reached.
   - Once all records are processed, the program terminates automatically, closing both files.

### Business Rules

1. **Direct Record Copy**:
   - The program performs a one-to-one copy of records from `EDIOUT` to `EDI810` without any transformation or validation of the record content.
   - Each record in `EDIOUT` is assumed to be correctly formatted for EDI transmission (likely in the EDI 810 invoice format, as implied by the file name).

2. **Sequential Processing**:
   - Records are processed sequentially, and all records in `EDIOUT` are copied to `EDI810`.
   - The program does not filter, modify, or skip records, ensuring all data is transferred to the permanent file.

3. **Purpose for Kleinschmidt**:
   - The comment indicates that `EDI810` is a permanent file used to send EDI data to Kleinschmidt, a third-party EDI service provider.
   - The program ensures that temporary EDI work data is preserved in a permanent file for external transmission.

4. **No Error Handling**:
   - The program does not include explicit error handling for file access, record validation, or I/O errors. It assumes that `EDIOUT` exists, is accessible, and contains valid records, and that `EDI810` can be written to without issues.

### Tables (Files) Used

1. **EDIOUT**:
   - **Description**: Temporary EDI work file.
   - **Attributes**: 128 bytes per record, primary input file (`IP`), disk-based.
   - **Fields Used**:
     - `RECORD` (128 bytes, positions 1–128): The entire record content.
   - **Purpose**: Contains temporary EDI invoice data (likely in EDI 810 format) generated during invoice processing.
   - **Usage**: Read sequentially to copy records to the permanent file.

2. **EDI810**:
   - **Description**: Permanent EDI file for transmission.
   - **Attributes**: 128 bytes per record, output file (`O`) with add capability (`A`), disk-based.
   - **Fields Used**:
     - `RECORD` (128 bytes, positions 1–128): The entire record content copied from `EDIOUT`.
   - **Purpose**: Stores EDI invoice data for transmission to Kleinschmidt, a third-party EDI service provider.
   - **Usage**: Records are added to this file using the `DADD` operation.

### External Programs Called

The `BB513` RPG program does not explicitly call any external programs. It is a self-contained program that performs a simple file copy operation, reading from `EDIOUT` and writing to `EDI810`.

### Summary

The `BB513` RPG program is a utility program called by an OCL program (not provided but likely part of the `BB600P.ocl36.txt` workflow) to copy EDI invoice records from a temporary work file (`EDIOUT`) to a permanent file (`EDI810`) for transmission to Kleinschmidt. It:
- Reads each 128-byte record from `EDIOUT` sequentially.
- Writes each record unchanged to `EDI810` using an add operation.
- Terminates after processing all records.

**Tables Used**: `EDIOUT` (temporary EDI work file), `EDI810` (permanent EDI file).
**External Programs Called**: None.

This program ensures that EDI invoice data is preserved in a permanent file for external transmission, maintaining the integrity of the EDI 810 invoice data for communication with trading partners via Kleinschmidt.
