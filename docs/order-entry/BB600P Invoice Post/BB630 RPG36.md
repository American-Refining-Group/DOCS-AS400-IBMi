The RPG program `BB630.rpg36.txt` is called by the `BB630.ocl36.txt` OCL program, which itself is part of the invoice posting workflow initiated by `BB600P.ocl36.txt`. This program is responsible for updating the Accounts Receivable (A/R) control file (`ARCONT`) by incrementing the Sales Journal (S/J) number (`ACSLJ#`). Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of the BB630 RPG Program

The `BB630` program is a concise RPG program that performs a specific task: updating the next Sales Journal number in the `ARCONT` file for a specific company. It operates on a single file and has minimal logic, focusing on ensuring the correct company is processed and updating the journal number.

#### Process Steps:
1. **Company Validation**:
   - The program checks if the company number (`ACCO`) in the `ARCONT` file matches the value `10` (`IFNE 10`).
   - If `ACCO` is not equal to `10`, the program branches to the `END` tag, effectively terminating without performing any updates.
   - This ensures that the program only processes records for company number `10`.

2. **Set Journal Type and Number**:
   - If the company number is `10`, the program sets the journal type (`TYPE`) to `'SJ'` (Sales Journal) in the User Data Structure (`UDS`).
   - It moves the current Sales Journal number (`ACSLJ#`) from the `ARCONT` record to the `SL#` field in the `UDS` for reference.
   - Increments the `ACSLJ#` field by 1 to prepare the next journal number.

3. **Update ARCONT File**:
   - The program executes an exception output (`EXCPT`) to write the updated `ACSLJ#` value back to the `ARCONT` file.
   - The output specification (`OARCONT E`) writes the `ACSLJ#` field to positions 36–37 of the `ARCONT` record.

4. **Termination**:
   - The program reaches the `END` tag and terminates, either after updating the `ACSLJ#` for company `10` or if the company number does not match.

### Business Rules

1. **Company-Specific Processing**:
   - The program only processes records where the company number (`ACCO`) is `10`. This restricts the update to a specific company, ensuring that the Sales Journal number is incremented only for the designated company.

2. **Sales Journal Number Increment**:
   - The Sales Journal number (`ACSLJ#`) is incremented by 1 each time the program runs for company `10`, ensuring a unique journal number for each sales posting transaction.
   - The journal type is set to `'SJ'` (Sales Journal) to indicate the type of journal entry being tracked.

3. **File Update**:
   - The `ARCONT` file is updated directly with the new `ACSLJ#` value, maintaining the next available Sales Journal number for subsequent transactions.

4. **No Error Handling**:
   - The program does not include explicit error handling or validation beyond the company number check. It assumes the `ARCONT` file is accessible and the record for company `10` exists.

### Tables (Files) Used

1. **ARCONT**:
   - **Description**: Accounts Receivable control file.
   - **Attributes**: 256 bytes, 2-byte key, update-capable (`UP`), alternate index (`AI`).
   - **Fields Used**:
     - `ACDEL` (1 byte, position 1): Delete flag.
     - `ACCO` (2 bytes, positions 2–3): Company number.
     - `ACNAME` (30 bytes, positions 4–33): Company name.
     - `ACSLJ#` (2 bytes, positions 36–37): Next Sales Journal number.
   - **Purpose**: Stores control information for A/R processing, specifically the next Sales Journal number (`ACSLJ#`) for the company.
   - **Usage**: The program reads the `ARCONT` record, checks the company number, increments `ACSLJ#`, and updates the record.
   - **Disposition**: Update-capable (`UP`), shared access (`DISP-SHR` as specified in `BB630.ocl36.txt`).

### External Programs Called

The `BB630` RPG program does not explicitly call any external programs. It is a self-contained program that performs a single, focused task of updating the `ARCONT` file.

### Summary

The `BB630` RPG program is a simple utility called by `BB630.ocl36.txt` to update the Sales Journal number (`ACSLJ#`) in the `ARCONT` file for company number `10`. It:
- Validates that the company number is `10`.
- Sets the journal type to `'SJ'` and increments the Sales Journal number.
- Updates the `ARCONT` file with the new journal number.
- Terminates without further processing if the company number does not match.

**Tables Used**: `ARCONT` (Accounts Receivable control file).
**External Programs Called**: None.

This program is likely invoked as part of the invoice posting process to ensure that each posting transaction receives a unique Sales Journal number, maintaining accurate A/R tracking for the specified company.
