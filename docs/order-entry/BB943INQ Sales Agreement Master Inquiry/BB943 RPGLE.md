The provided document is an RPGLE program named `BB943`, called from the OCL procedure `BB943INQ.ocl36.txt` and referenced by the `BB943P` program in the IBM System/36 (or AS/400 compatibility mode) environment. This program handles "Customer Sales Agreement Maintenance," allowing users to add, update, or inquire about customer sales agreement records. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called, based on the provided RPGLE source code, the OCL context, and the integration with `BB943P`.

### Process Steps of the RPGLE Program

The `BB943` program is an interactive RPGLE program designed for maintaining and inquiring about customer sales agreements. It operates in two modes: inquiry (`INQ`) and maintenance (`MNT`), controlled by input parameters. The program uses a display file for user interaction and manages data in the sales agreement file (`bicuag`) and related files. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Receive Parameters**: The program accepts several parameters via the `*ENTRY` plist:
     - `p$cono` (company number).
     - `p$stat` (3 characters, status, e.g., `'CF '` for active).
     - `p$validpw` (1 character, valid password flag, set to `'Y'` for user `'KRAJTEST'`).
     - `p$sqky` (sequence number key for the agreement).
     - `p$frsq` (copy-from sequence number for copying records).
     - `c1f6flag` (1 character, for F6 defaults).
     - `c1cust`, `c1loc`, `c1cntr`, `c1prcd`, `c1prim`, `c1ship` (fields from `BB943P` for pre-populating data).
     - `p$mode` (3 characters, `'INQ'` or `'MNT'`).
     - `p$fgrp` (1 character, file group `'G'` or `'Z'`).
     - `p$flag` (1 character, return flag).
     - `p$dspmsg` (1 character, message flag for expiration messages).
   - **Set Current Date/Time**: Uses the `TIME` operation to populate `t#time` and converts it to `t#cymd` (CCYYMMDD format) for date validations.
   - **Initialize Fields**: Clears work fields (e.g., `s1sttm`, `s1entm`, `s1prce`, `s1offp`), sets defaults (e.g., `fmtagn`, `delagn` to `*off`), and initializes message handling fields (`dspmsg`, `m@pgmq`).
   - **Define Key Lists**: Sets up key lists (`klcust`, `klship`, `klcupr`, `klcomm`, `klloc`, `klvend`, `klcuag1`, `klcua3`, `klcnty`, `klprod`, `p$frsqkey`, `f$sqkey`) for file access based on fields like company, customer, location, container, and product codes.
   - **Move Parameters**: Transfers `p$sqky` to `f$sq` (sequence number) and `p$stat` to `s1stat` for display.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - **File Overrides**: Based on `p$fgrp` (`'G'` or `'Z'`), applies file overrides using `ovg` or `ovz` arrays (e.g., `ovrdbf file(arcust) tofile(*libl/garcust)` for `'G'` group). Executes overrides using `QCMDEXC`.
   - **Open Files**: Opens all defined files (`arcust`, `bicont`, `gscntr1`, `gsprod`, `apvend`, `gstabl`, `inloc`, `shipto`, `trrtcd`, `arcupr`, `bicuag`, `bicua3`, `arcomm`, `bicuagh`) with `usropn` for controlled access.
   - **Clear Messages**: Calls `clrmsg` to clear the message subfile.

3. **Main Processing (Not Fully Shown Due to Truncation)**:
   - The program likely contains a main loop to display and process the customer sales agreement maintenance screen using the `bb943d` display file. The loop handles user input (e.g., function keys like F6 for carrier/billed/all values, Enter for submission) and performs validations.
   - **Display File Interaction**: Uses the `bb943d` display file with formats for maintenance or inquiry, controlled by indicators:
     - `*IN70`: Protects all fields in `'INQ'` mode.
     - `*IN71`: Protects key fields in update mode (`'MNT'`).
     - `*IN72`: Protects fields if no password is entered.
   - **Subfile Processing**: Likely processes a subfile (though not explicitly shown in the truncated code) for listing agreement details, using indicators `*IN40` (subfile clear), `*IN41` (subfile display control), `*IN42` (subfile display), and `*IN43` (subfile end/next change).
   - **Field Validation**: Validates input fields (e.g., company, customer, product codes) using key lists and chaining to files like `arcust`, `bicont`, `gscntr1`, and `gsprod`.
   - **Record Maintenance**:
     - **Add**: In `'MNT'` mode, allows creating new records in `bicuag` (update file with `uf a e`).
     - **Update**: Updates existing records based on `p$sqky` or other keys.
     - **Copy**: Copies a record from `p$frsq` to a new sequence number.
     - **Expiration**: Handles record expiration (per `jk04`, expires original record if expiration date is greater than the new record’s start date or is zero).

4. **Message Handling (`addmsg`, `wrtmsg`, `clrmsg` Subroutines)**:
   - **Add Message (`addmsg`)**: Sends messages to the program message queue using `QMHSNDPM`, calculating the message length (`m@l`) and setting `dspmsg` to `*on`.
   - **Write Message (`wrtmsg`)**: Writes to the message subfile (`msgctl`) using `*IN49`.
   - **Clear Message (`clrmsg`)**: Clears the message subfile using `QMHRMVPM`, saving and restoring the current record format (`rcdnam`) and page relative record number (`pagrrn`).

5. **Program Termination (Not Fully Shown)**:
   - Likely closes all files (`close *all`) and sets `*inlr = *on` to terminate, similar to `BB943P`.

### Business Rules

The program enforces several business rules for managing customer sales agreements:

1. **Mode-Based Access**:
   - In `'INQ'` mode, all fields are protected (`*IN70 = *on`), allowing only viewing.
   - In `'MNT'` mode, fields are editable, but key fields may be protected (`*IN71 = *on`) during updates, and fields are protected if no valid password is provided (`*IN72 = *on`).

2. **Validation**:
   - **Company (`bacono`)**: Must exist in `bicont` (company file).
   - **Customer (`bacust`)**: Must exist in `arcust` (customer master file).
   - **Ship-to (`baship`)**: Validated against `shipto` file.
   - **Product Codes (`bapr01`–`bapr10`)**: Validated against `gsprod`, with checks for duplicates (`svpc` array) and at least one valid product code (error `com(05)`).
   - **Container (`bacntr`)**: Validated against `gscntr1`, but can be blank for non-fluid products (per `JB04`).
   - **Container Type**: Removed ability to enter container type (per `jb13`, 07/22/2024).
   - **Expiration Date**: Cannot be before the start date (error `com(06)`). Original record expires only if its expiration date is greater than the new record’s start date or is zero (per `jk04`).
   - **Min/Max Quantity**: Maximum quantity (`s1mxqy`) cannot be less than minimum quantity (`s1mnqy`, error `com(11)`).
   - **PO/Order Code**: Must be `'P'` (PO) or `'O'` (Order, error `com(12)`, per `mg11`).

3. **Duplicate Checks**:
   - Prevents duplicate product codes (`com(04)`), locations (`com(07)`), ship-to addresses (`com(08)`), and customer ship-to combinations (`com(09)`).
   - Allows multiple records with the same start date if freight codes differ (per `mg12`) or for other conditions (per `mg12`).

4. **Expiration Handling**:
   - Expired records are written to the history file (`bicuagh`, per `jk04`).
   - Sets ending date of expired record to one minute earlier than the new record’s start time (per `mg12`).

5. **Commission Information**:
   - Includes commission data from `arcomm` when applicable (per `mg09`).

6. **Default Values**:
   - Sets `p$validpw` to `'Y'` for user `'KRAJTEST'`.
   - Sets `s1prim` to `'I'` if blank (per `jb08`).
   - Uses `0000` as the default start time instead of `0001` (per `mg10`).

7. **Price and Off-Price Fields**:
   - Expanded `s1prce` and `s1offp` to 9.4 packed decimal (per `jk05`).

8. **Container Type Lookup**:
   - Attempts to retrieve `arcupr` record with container type first, then with blank container type if not found (per `jb06`).

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files, as defined in the File Specification (F-spec) section:

1. **bb943d**: Display file (workstation file) for interactive user interface, likely with subfile support.
2. **arcust**: Customer master file, input-only, keyed.
3. **bicont**: Company file, update/input, keyed.
4. **gscntr1**: Container file (replaced `gscntr` per `jk06`), input-only, keyed.
5. **gsprod**: Product file, input-only, keyed.
6. **apvend**: Vendor file, input-only, keyed.
7. **gstabl**: Table file (for codes or configurations), input-only, keyed.
8. **inloc**: Location file, input-only, keyed.
9. **shipto**: Ship-to address file, input-only, keyed.
10. **trrtcd**: Transportation rate code file, input-only, keyed.
11. **arcupr**: Customer pricing file, input-only, keyed.
12. **arcomm**: Commission file (added per `jk03`), input-only, keyed.
13. **bicua3**: Alternate sales agreement file (replaced `bicua2` per `jk03`), input-only, keyed, with renamed record format (`bicuagpf` to `bicuaglf`).
14. **bicuagh**: Sales agreement history file, output-only, keyed.
15. **bicuag**: Primary sales agreement file, update/add/input, keyed.

**File Overrides**:
- The `ovg` and `ovz` arrays specify overrides for file groups `'G'` and `'Z'`, mapping files to libraries (e.g., `garcust`, `zbicuag`).

Due to the truncation of the source code (110,200 characters), some details about the main loop, subfile processing, and additional subroutines (e.g., validation, add/update logic) are not fully visible. If you can provide the complete `BB943.rpgle` code or specific sections (e.g., main loop, validation subroutines), I can refine the process steps and business rules further. Additionally, if you have the display file (`bb943d`) or source for called programs like `BB9643V`, I can provide more context. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
