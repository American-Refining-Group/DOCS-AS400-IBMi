The provided document is an RPGLE program named `BB944`, called from the OCL procedure `BB943INQ.ocl36.txt` in the IBM System/36 (or AS/400 compatibility mode) environment. This program, titled "Customer Sales Agreement Delete Program," is designed to delete or reactivate customer sales agreement records in the `bicuag` file, with history logging to the `bicuagh` file. It interacts with users via a display file (`bb944d`) and supports operations like marking records for deletion or reactivating previously deleted records. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called, based on the provided RPGLE source code and its context within the customer sales agreement maintenance system, integrating with `BB943`, `BB943V`, `BB9433`, and `GSDTCLC1`.

### Process Steps of the RPGLE Program

The `BB944` program is an interactive module that allows users to delete or reactivate customer sales agreement records based on a provided company number (`p$cono`) and sequence number (`p$seqn`). It uses a display file (`bb944d`) for user interaction and updates the `bicuag` file, logging changes to `bicuagh`. Due to the truncation of the source code (9,696 characters), some logic (e.g., the `srfmt` and `rtvdta` subroutines) is incomplete, but I’ll reconstruct the process steps based on the available code and context.

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Receive Parameters**: The program accepts four parameters via the `*ENTRY` plist:
     - `p$cono` (company number, defined like `bacono`).
     - `p$seqn` (sequence number, defined like `baseqn`).
     - `p$fgrp` (1 character, file group: `'G'` or `'Z'` for file overrides).
     - `p$flag` (1 character, return flag: e.g., `'1'` for success, `'0'` for failure).
   - **Set System Information**: Uses the `psds##` program status data structure to retrieve:
     - `ps#pgm` (program name).
     - `ps#usr` (user ID, 10 characters).
     - `ps#usr8` (user ID, 8 characters, per `jk01`).
     - `ps#mdy` (job date, MMDDYY).
     - `ps#hms` (job time, HHMMSS).
   - **Set Current Date/Time**: Uses the `TIME` operation to populate `t#time` (14-digit timestamp) and converts it to `t#cymd` (8-digit CCYYMMDD) for history record timestamps.
   - **Initialize Fields**:
     - Output parameters: Clears `o$fgrp`, `o$mode`, and `o$flag`.
     - Work fields: Sets `l$cncd` (container code, 2.0) to zeros, `w$cnty` (container type, 1 character) to blanks.
     - Control flags: Sets `fmtagn` and `delagn` to `*off` for controlling format and deletion window processing.
     - Message fields: Initializes `dspmsg` to blank, `m@pgmq` to `'*'`, and `m@key` to blanks.
   - **Define Key Lists**:
     - `klship`: For accessing `shipto` with `bacono`, `bacust`, and `baship`.
     - `klcuag`: For accessing `bicuag` with `p$cono` and `p$seqn`.
     - `klcnty`: For accessing `gstabl` with `k$cntrty` (set to `'CNTRTY'`) and `k$cnty` (container type).
   - **Open Database Tables**: Calls `opntbl` to apply file overrides and open files.
   - **Note**: Test parameters (commented out, e.g., `p$cprf = 'E0910114'`, `p$mode = 'MNT'`) are for debugging and not used in production.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - **File Overrides**: Based on `p$fgrp` (`'G'` or `'Z'`), applies file overrides using `ovg` or `ovz` arrays (e.g., `ovrdbf file(bicuag) tofile(*libl/gbicuag)` for `'G'`). Executes overrides with `QCMDEXC` for five files.
   - **Open Files**: Opens the following files with `usropn`:
     - `gscntr1` (container file, input-only, keyed, replaced `gscntr` per `jk02`).
     - `gstabl` (table file for codes, input-only, keyed).
     - `shipto` (ship-to address file, input-only, keyed).
     - `bicuag` (sales agreement file, update/input, keyed).
     - `bicuagh` (sales agreement history file, output-only, keyed, added per `jk01`).
   - **Purpose**: Ensures access to the correct file library (`G` or `Z`) for data operations.

3. **Retrieve Data (`rtvdta` Subroutine, Truncated)**:
   - **Chain to `bicuag`**: Likely uses `klcuag` (`p$cono`, `p$seqn`) to retrieve the sales agreement record.
   - **Check Record Status**:
     - If the record’s end date (`baend8`) is non-zero, sets `*IN71` to `*ON` (record has expired).
     - If the record’s deletion flag (`badel`) is `'Y'`, sets `*IN72` to `*ON` (record is marked deleted, action is reactivate); otherwise, `*IN72 = *OFF` (record is active, action is delete).
   - **Populate Display Fields**: Moves `bicuag` fields (e.g., `bacono`, `bacust`, `baloc`, `bacntr`, `baship`, `bapr01`–`bapr10`, `bapord`, `bastd8`, `baend8`, `baprce`, `baoffp`) to display file fields (`f$`, `s1`, or `s2` prefixes) for user confirmation.
   - **Validate Related Data**: Likely chains to `gscntr1` (container), `gstabl` (unit of measure, container type), and `shipto` (ship-to address) to display descriptions.

4. **Process Panel Formats (`srfmt` Subroutine, Partially Truncated)**:
   - **Initialize Window**: Sets `winagn = *ON` to indicate the main window is active.
   - **Main Window Loop**:
     - Displays the `bb944d` display file, likely with a subfile (`sfl1` or `sfl2`) for agreement details, controlled by indicators:
       - `*IN40`: Subfile clear.
       - `*IN41`: Subfile display control.
       - `*IN42`: Subfile display.
       - `*IN43`: Subfile end/next change.
       - `*IN71`: Record has expired.
       - `*IN72`: Action is reactivate (`*ON`) or delete (`*OFF`).
     - Processes user input (function keys: `F23` for delete, `F22` for reactivate, `F12` for cancel, `ENTER` for confirmation, `PAGEDN` for scrolling).
   - **Handle Function Keys**:
     - **F23 (Delete)**: Marks the record for deletion by setting `badel = 'Y'` in `bicuag` and writes to `bicuagh`.
     - **F22 (Reactivate)**: Clears `badel = ' '` to reactivate the record.
     - **F12 (Cancel)**: Exits without changes, setting `p$flag = '0'`.
     - **ENTER**: Confirms the delete/reactivate action, updating `bicuag` and logging to `bicuagh`.
   - **Subfile Processing**: Uses `*IN88` for `READC` (read changed subfile) and `*IN49` for message subfile display/control.

5. **Clear Message Subfile (`clrmsg` Subroutine)**:
   - **Clear Messages**: Calls `QMHRMVPM` to remove messages from the program message queue.
   - **Save/Restore Context**: Saves and restores the current record format (`rcdnam` to `rcdsav`) and subfile page relative record number (`pagrrn` to `pagsav`).
   - **Parameters**: Passes `m@pgmq`, `m@scnt`, `m@rmvk`, `m@rmv`, and `m@errc` to `QMHRMVPM`.
   - **Set Flag**: Sets `dspmsg = *OFF` to indicate no messages are displayed.

6. **Write to History File (Implied, Not Shown)**:
   - When deleting a record, likely writes a copy to `bicuagh` with audit fields:
     - `hhchd8` (change date, set to `t#cymd`).
     - `hhchtm` (change time, set to `t#hms`).
     - `hhuser` (user ID, set to `ps#usr8`, per `jk01`).
   - Uses `wkdshist` (external data structure for `bicuagh`) to populate fields.

7. **Program Termination**:
   - Closes all files (`close *all`).
   - Sets `*inlr = *on` to terminate.
   - Returns `p$flag` to indicate success (`'1'`) or failure/cancellation (`'0'`).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules for deleting or reactivating customer sales agreements:

1. **Delete vs. Reactivate**:
   - If the record’s deletion flag (`badel`) is `'Y'`, the action is to reactivate (`*IN72 = *ON`, `F22=ReActivate`).
   - If `badel` is blank, the action is to delete (`*IN72 = *OFF`, `F23=Delete`).
   - Expired records (`baend8 ≠ 0`) are marked with `*IN71 = *ON` for display purposes.

2. **Record Retrieval**:
   - Retrieves the agreement from `bicuag` using `p$cono` and `p$seqn` (`klcuag`).
   - Validates related data (container in `gscntr1`, unit of measure/container type in `gstabl`, ship-to in `shipto`).

3. **History Logging (per `jk01`)**:
   - When a record is deleted, a copy is written to `bicuagh` with audit fields (`hhchd8`, `hhchtm`, `hhuser`).
   - The deletion flag (`badel`) is copied to `hhdel` in the history record.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Displays the agreement details for confirmation using `bb944d`.
   - Supports function keys:
     - `F23`: Marks `badel = 'Y'` and logs to `bicuagh`.
     - `F22`: Clears `badel = ' '` to reactivate.
     - `F12`: Cancels the operation.
     - `ENTER`: Confirms the delete/reactivate action.
     - `PAGEDN`: Scrolls the subfile.
   - Protects input fields in certain modes (`*IN70–*IN79`).

5. **Validation**:
   - Ensures the agreement exists in `bicuag` before processing.
   - Validates container codes (`gscntr1`, replaced `gscntr` per `jk02`) and other fields (via `gstabl`, `shipto`).

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays errors using the message subfile (`*IN49`) with messages stored in `m@80` array and `GSMSGF` message file.
   - Positions the cursor (`csrloc`) on error fields (`*IN50–*IN69`, `*IN21–*IN39`).

### Tables Used

The program uses the following files, as defined in the File Specification (F-spec) section:

1. **bb944d**: Display file (workstation file) for user interaction, likely with subfile support (`sfl1` or `sfl2`).
2. **gscntr1**: Container file (replaced `gscntr` per `jk02`), input-only, keyed.
3. **gstabl**: Table file (for codes like unit of measure, container type), input-only, keyed.
4. **shipto**: Ship-to address file, input-only, keyed.
5. **bicuag**: Sales agreement file, update/input, keyed.
6. **bicuagh**: Sales agreement history file (added per `jk01`), output-only, keyed.

**File Overrides**:
- The `ovg` and `ovz` arrays specify overrides for file groups `'G'` and `'Z'`, mapping files to libraries (e.g., `ggscntr1`, `zbicuagh`).

---

### External Programs Called

The program explicitly calls one external program:

1. **QCMDEXC**:
   - Called in the `opntbl` subroutine to execute file override commands.
   - Parameters: `dbov##` (override command string, 80 bytes), `dbol##` (length, 15.5).

2. **QMHRMVPM**:
   - Called in the `clrmsg` subroutine to clear messages from the message subfile.
   - Parameters: `m@pgmq`, `m@scnt`, `m@rmvk`, `m@rmv`, `m@errc`.

No other external programs are explicitly called, though `GSDTCLC1` (from the previous context) may be used for date calculations in the truncated `rtvdta` or `srfmt` subroutines.

### Summary

- **Process Steps**:
  1. Initialize by receiving `p$cono`, `p$seqn`, `p$fgrp`, and `p$flag`, setting date/time, and defining key lists.
  2. Apply file overrides and open files (`opntbl`).
  3. Retrieve agreement data from `bicuag` and related files (`rtvdta`, truncated).
  4. Process user interaction via `bb944d`, handling delete (`F23`), reactivate (`F22`), or cancel (`F12`) actions (`srfmt`, partially truncated).
  5. Clear message subfile (`clrmsg`).
  6. Update `bicuag` (set `badel`) and log to `bicuagh` for deletions.
  7. Terminate, closing files and returning `p$flag`.

- **Business Rules**:
  - Deletes records by setting `badel = 'Y'` (`F23`) or reactivates by clearing `badel` (`F22`), based on `*IN72`.
  - Logs deleted records to `bicuagh` with audit fields (`jk01`).
  - Validates agreement existence and related data (container, ship-to).
  - Displays expired records with `*IN71`.
  - Handles user input with function keys and subfile navigation.
  - Uses `G` or `Z` file groups for overrides.

- **Tables Used**:
  - `bb944d`, `gscntr1`, `gstabl`, `shipto`, `bicuag`, `bicuagh`.

- **External Programs Called**:
  - `QCMDEXC` (for file overrides).
  - `QMHRMVPM` (for message clearing).

Due to the truncation of the source code, details of the `srfmt` and `rtvdta` subroutines are incomplete, limiting visibility into the full display logic and record processing. If you can provide the complete `BB944.rpgle` code or specific sections (e.g., `srfmt`, `rtvdta`), I can refine the process steps and business rules further. Additionally, if you have the display file (`bb944d`) or related programs, I can provide more context. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
