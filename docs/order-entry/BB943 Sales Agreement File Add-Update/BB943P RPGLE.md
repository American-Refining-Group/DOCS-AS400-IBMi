The RPG program `BB943P.rpgle` is an IBM i (AS/400) program designed for "Work With Customer Sales Agreements." It provides an interactive interface using a display file with subfiles to manage customer sales agreement records. The program supports maintenance and inquiry modes, allowing users to view, add, copy, delete, or display sales agreement records. Below, I will explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called, based on the provided RPG source code.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

The `BB943P` program follows a structured flow typical of RPG interactive applications on IBM i, using a display file with a subfile to present and manage data. Here are the key process steps:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Parameters**: The program receives two input parameters:
     - `p$mode` (3 characters): Determines the run mode, either 'MNT' (maintenance) or 'INQ' (inquiry).
     - `p$fgrp` (1 character): Specifies the file group ('G' or 'Z'), which determines the database files to use via overrides.
   - **File Overrides**: Based on `p$fgrp`, the program applies database file overrides (`ovg` for 'G' or `ovz` for 'Z') to point to the appropriate files (e.g., `garcust` or `zarcust`).
   - **File Opens**: Opens all required database files (`arcust`, `bicont`, `bicuag`, `gscntr1`, `gsprod`, `gstabl`, `inloc`, `shipto`, `bicuax`, `bicua10`) with `USROPN` to control file access.
   - **Variable Initialization**: Sets up work fields, subfile control fields, and message handling fields. Initializes the current date and time for use in processing.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - Executes the `QCMDEXC` API to apply file overrides based on `p$fgrp`.
   - Opens all input files for reading, ensuring the program can access customer, sales agreement, and related data.

3. **Process Subfile (`srsfl1` Subroutine)**:
   - **Clear Message Subfile**: Calls `clrmsg` to clear any existing messages in the message subfile.
   - **Initialize Subfile**: Sets the subfile mode to 'folded' (`sfmod1 = '1'`, `*in45 = *on`) for the initial load and initializes control fields (e.g., `c1cono` to 10).
   - **Set Filters**: Initializes the expired entries filter (`w$expd = *off`, `F8=Incl Del`) and the ascending/descending sort order (`f13sel = 'D'`, `F13=Descend`).
   - **Global Protection**: Sets `*in70` (global protect) based on `p$mode`. In 'INQ' mode, fields are protected (`*in70 = *on`); in 'MNT' mode, fields are editable (`*in70 = *off`).
   - **Position File**: Calls `sf1rep` to position the file cursor based on user input or defaults.
   - **Main Loop**:
     - Displays the command line and message subfile.
     - Checks for existing subfile records to enable/disable display (`*in41`).
     - Sets folded/unfolded mode for the subfile (`*in45`).
     - Displays the subfile control record (`sflctl1`) using `EXFMT`.
     - Processes user input (function keys, cursor location, and subfile records).

4. **Handle User Input**:
   - **Function Keys**:
     - **F03 (Exit)**: Exits the program by setting `sf1agn = *off`.
     - **F04 (Prompt)**: Calls `prompt` to allow field-specific prompting (e.g., customer, ship-to, location).
     - **F05 (Refresh)**: Triggers a subfile refresh by setting `repsfl = *on`.
     - **F08 (Toggle Expired Entries)**: Toggles the `w$expd` flag to include/exclude expired entries and updates the subfile.
     - **F09 (History Inquiry)**: Calls `histinq` to invoke `GB730P` for customer history inquiry.
     - **F13 (Toggle Ascend/Descend)**: Toggles the sort order (`f13sel` between 'A' and 'D') and refreshes the subfile.
     - **PAGEDN (Page Down)**: Calls `sf1lod` to load additional subfile records.
     - **ENTER**: Validates the password (`validatepw`) and processes subfile records (`sf1prc`).
     - **F06 (Add)**: Validates the password and calls `sf1add` to add a new record.
     - **F10 (Position Cursor)**: Clears cursor position to focus on the control record.
     - **Control Field Changes**: If control fields (e.g., `c1cono`, `c1cust`) change, repositions the subfile via `sf1rep`.

5. **Process Subfile Records (`sf1prc` Subroutine)**:
   - Reads changed subfile records (`readc sfl1`) and processes them via `sf1chg`.
   - Handles options selected in the subfile (e.g., 2=Change, 3=Copy, 4=Delete, 5=Display).

6. **Process Subfile Options (`sf1chg` Subroutine)**:
   - **Option 2 (Change)**: If in 'MNT' mode and the record is not deleted, calls `sf1s02` to modify the record.
   - **Option 3 (Copy)**: If in 'MNT' mode and not deleted, calls `sf1s03` to copy the record.
   - **Option 4 (Delete)**: If in 'MNT' mode, calls `sf1s04` to delete the record.
   - **Option 5 (Display)**: Calls `sf1s05` to display the record details.
   - Updates the subfile record after processing.

7. **Reposition Subfile (`sf1rep` Subroutine)**:
   - Clears the subfile (`sf1clr`).
   - Validates control field input (`sf1cte`).
   - Positions the file cursor based on sort order (`f13sel`) and user input (e.g., `c1cono`, `c1cust`, `c1cntr`).
   - Loads the subfile (`sf1lod`).

8. **Edit Control Fields (`sf1cte` Subroutine)**:
   - Validates the company (`c1cono`) and customer (`c1cust`) fields against `bicont` and `arcust` files.
   - Sets error messages if validation fails (e.g., `ERR0010` for invalid company).

9. **Subfile Option Processing**:
   - **Copy (`sf1s03`)**: Calls `BB943` to copy a record, passing parameters like company, status, and sequence number. Displays success (`ERR0000`, `com(04)`) or failure (`com(09)`) messages.
   - **Delete (`sf1s04`)**: Calls `BB944` to mark a record as deleted ('D') or reactivated ('A'), displaying appropriate messages (`com(05)` or `com(06)`).
   - **Display (`sf1s05`)**: Calls `BB943` in 'INQ' mode to display record details.
   - **History Inquiry (`histinq`)**: Calls `GB730P` with customer history parameters.

10. **Message Handling**:
    - **Add Message (`addmsg`)**: Sends messages to the program message queue using `QMHSNDPM`.
    - **Write Message (`wrtmsg`)**: Writes messages to the message subfile.
    - **Clear Message (`clrmsg`)**: Clears the message subfile using `QMHRMVPM`.

11. **Program Termination**:
    - Closes all files (`close *all`).
    - Sets `*inlr = *on` and returns.

### Business Rules

The program enforces several business rules to ensure proper management of customer sales agreements:

1. **Mode-Based Access Control**:
   - In 'MNT' mode, users can add, change, copy, or delete records (`*in70 = *off` for editable fields).
   - In 'INQ' mode, fields are protected (`*in70 = *on`), allowing only viewing.

2. **Validation of Input**:
   - Company (`c1cono`) and customer (`c1cust`) must exist in `bicont` and `arcust` files, respectively, or an error (`ERR0010`) is displayed.
   - Ship-to codes require a valid customer code (`com(01)`).

3. **Password Validation**:
   - For add or copy operations, a password (`c1agpw`) is required unless blank, in which case it defaults to 'N' (`w$validpw`).
   - The password is validated via `validatepw` and passed to called programs.

4. **Expired Records Filter**:
   - Users can toggle inclusion/exclusion of expired records using F8 (`w$expd` and `fky` labels).
   - Expired records are filtered based on the `w$expd` flag during subfile loading.

5. **Sort Order**:
   - Users can toggle ascending (`f13sel = 'A'`) or descending (`f13sel = 'D'`) sort order using F13, affecting how records are loaded into the subfile.

6. **Record Status**:
   - Deleted records (`s1del = 'D'`) cannot be modified (`com(08)`).
   - Copy operations check for expired records and display a message if applicable (`com(11)`).

7. **Partial PO Data Entry**:
   - As of revision `jk06` (08/31/18), the program supports partial purchase order (PO) data entry for scanning purposes.

8. **Container Type Restriction**:
   - As of revision `jb07` (07/22/24), users cannot enter container types in sales agreements, restricting input flexibility.

9. **Subfile Options**:
   - **Option 2 (Change)**: Allowed in 'MNT' mode for non-deleted records.
   - **Option 3 (Copy)**: Copies a record to a new sequence number, with success or failure messages.
   - **Option 4 (Delete)**: Marks records as deleted ('D') or reactivated ('A').
   - **Option 5 (Display)**: Displays record details in inquiry mode.

10. **Error and Success Messages**:
    - Messages are displayed for actions like record creation (`com(02)`), change (`com(03)`), copy (`com(04)`), deletion (`com(05)`), reactivation (`com(06)`), or errors (e.g., `com(09)`, `com(11)`).

### Tables Used

The program uses the following database files, with overrides applied based on `p$fgrp` ('G' or 'Z'):

1. **arcust**: Customer master file, containing customer details (e.g., customer ID, name).
2. **bicont**: Company master file, containing company details.
3. **bicuag**: Sales agreement file, primary file for customer sales agreements.
4. **gscntr1**: Container file (replaced `gscntr` per revision `jk05`), with an alpha key.
5. **gsprod**: Product file, containing product details.
6. **gstabl**: Table file, likely for reference data (e.g., container types).
7. **inloc**: Location file, containing location details.
8. **shipto**: Ship-to file, containing ship-to addresses.
9. **bicuax**: Renamed sales agreement file (record format `bicuagp1`), used for specific key access.
10. **bicua10**: Renamed sales agreement file (record format `bicuagp2`), used for alternate key access (per revision `jk02`).

The overrides (`ovg` and `ovz`) map these files to specific libraries (e.g., `garcust` or `zarcust`), ensuring the correct dataset is used based on the file group.

### External Programs Called

The program calls the following external programs:

1. **QCMDEXC**: System API to execute file override commands.
2. **QMHSNDPM**: System API to send messages to the program message queue.
3. **QMHRMVPM**: System API to remove messages from the message queue.
4. **BB943**: Called for copy (option 3) and display (option 5) operations, passing parameters like company, status, sequence number, and mode ('MNT' or 'INQ').
5. **BB944**: Called for delete (option 4) operations, handling record deletion or reactivation.
6. **GB730P**: Called for history inquiry (F9), passing customer history parameters.
7. **LARCUST**: Called for customer field prompting (F4 on `C1CUST`), returning a selected customer.
8. **LCSTSHP**: Called for ship-to field prompting (F4 on `C1SHIP`), returning customer and ship-to codes.

### Summary

- **Process Steps**: The program initializes parameters and files, opens database tables, displays a subfile for user interaction, processes function keys (F3, F4, F5, F8, F9, F13, etc.), validates input, and handles subfile options (change, copy, delete, display). It uses message subfiles for feedback and closes files upon termination.
- **Business Rules**: Enforces mode-based access ('MNT' vs. 'INQ'), validates company/customer input, requires passwords for certain actions, supports expired record filtering, toggles sort order, restricts container type entry, and provides feedback via messages.
- **Tables Used**: `arcust`, `bicont`, `bicuag`, `gscntr1`, `gsprod`, `gstabl`, `inloc`, `shipto`, `bicuax`, `bicua10`.
- **External Programs Called**: `QCMDEXC`, `QMHSNDPM`, `QMHRMVPM`, `BB943`, `BB944`, `GB730P`, `LARCUST`, `LCSTSHP`, `LINLOC`, `LGSCNCD`, `LGSPROD`.
