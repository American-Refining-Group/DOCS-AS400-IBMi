The RPG program `BB943V.rpgle` (referred to as `BB9643V` in the `BB943` program) is an IBM i (AS/400) validation program called by `BB943` to validate input fields for the Customer Sales Agreement Maintenance process. It ensures that the data entered in the sales agreement record adheres to specific business rules before it is added or updated in the `bicuag` file. Below, I will explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called based on the provided RPG source code.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

The `BB943V` program is designed to validate a data structure (`CUAGDS`) containing customer sales agreement fields passed from `BB943`. It performs checks against multiple database files and returns error messages or cursor positioning information if validation fails. Here are the key process steps:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine, Implicit)**:
   - **Parameters**: Receives two parameters:
     - `CUAGDS`: A data structure containing fields like company (`CONO`), customer (`CUST`), location (`ALOC`), container (`KCNTR`), product codes (`S3PR`), start/end dates (`STDT`, `ENDT`), and others (see `CUAGDS` definition).
     - `p$fgrp`: File group ('G' or 'Z') to determine database file overrides.
   - **Y2K Setup**: Sets `y2kcen = 19` and `y2kcmp = 80` for date handling (likely for legacy Y2K compatibility, per `jb01`).

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - Applies file overrides (`ovg` or `ovz`) based on `p$fgrp` using the `QCMDEXC` API, mapping files to appropriate libraries (e.g., `gbicont` or `zbicont`).
   - Opens input files (`BICONT`, `ARCUST`, `SHIPTO`, `INLOC`, `GSTABL`, `GSCNTR1`, `BICUA3`, `BICUA9`, `BBORDH`, `GSPROD`) with `USROPN` for validation checks.

3. **Main Validation Logic (`$SBLK` Subroutine)**:
   - Initializes error flags and message fields (`@MSG`, `@PC`).
   - Performs validation checks on the `CUAGDS` data structure fields, including:
     - **Company (`CONO`)**: Chains to `BICONT` to verify the company exists (`COM(01)` if invalid).
     - **Customer (`CUST`)**: Chains to `ARCUST` to verify the customer exists (`COM(06)` if not found).
     - **Location (`ALOC`)**: Chains to `INLOC` to verify the location exists (`COM(20)` if invalid).
     - **Container (`KCNTR`)**: Chains to `GSCNTR1` to verify the container code (`COM(33)` if invalid). Checks container type (`TCCNTY`) against `GSTABL` (`COM(32)` if invalid).
     - **Unit of Measure (`UNMS`)**: Validates against `GSTABL` (`COM(08)` or `COM(50)` if invalid).
     - **Product Codes (`S3PR`)**: Ensures at least one valid product code is entered (`COM(09)`), checks for duplicates (`COM(11)`), and verifies against `GSPROD` (`COM(51)`). Ensures fluid products have a valid container (`COM(54)`) and non-fluid products have a blank container (`COM(17)`, `COM(52)`).
     - **Purchase Order (`PORD`)**: Validates against `BBORDH` if `S3POOR = 'O'` (`COM(13)` if invalid).
     - **Ship-To (`SHIP`, `ALSH`)**: Validates ship-to codes against `SHIPTO`. Ensures `ALSH = 'Y'` implies `SHIP = 0` (`COM(28)`), and `ALSH = 'N'` implies `SHIP ≠ 0` (`COM(49)`). Checks for valid ship-to (`COM(48)`).
     - **Other Locations (`S3LO`)**: Ensures no duplicates (`COM(40)`) and validates against `INLOC`.
     - **Other Ship-To (`S3SH`)**: Ensures no duplicates (`COM(43)`) and validates against `SHIPTO`.
     - **Other Customer Ship-To (`S3CS`)**: Ensures no duplicates (`COM(56)`, `COM(57)`) and validates customer/ship-to combinations against `ARCUST` and `SHIPTO`.
     - **Start/End Dates and Times (`STDT`, `STTM`, `ENDT`, `ENTM`)**: Validates date formats and ensures end date/time follows start date/time (`COM(15)`, `COM(18)`, `COM(35)`). Checks hours (00-23, `COM(21)`, `COM(23)`) and minutes (00-59, `COM(22)`, `COM(24)`). Ensures non-zero times (`COM(25)`, `COM(26)`).
     - **Freight Code (`FRCD`)**: Validates against `GSTABL` (`COM(31)` if invalid).
     - **Prepaid (`PPD`)**: Must be 'P' or blank (`COM(55)`).
     - **Primary Flag (`PRIM`)**: Must be 'I' or 'M' (`COM(29)`).
     - **Min/Max Quantity (`MNQY`, `MXQY`)**: Ensures `MXQY ≥ MNQY` (implicit check, no specific error message listed).
     - **PO/Order Code (`S3POOR`)**: Must be 'P' or 'O' (`COM(36)`).
     - **Password (`KAGPW`)**: Validates against `BICONT` (`BCAGPW`, `COM(34)`). Requires a password if the start date is more than 3 days ago (`COM(37)`).

4. **Duplicate Record Check (`EDITS3` Subroutine)**:
   - For **add** operations (`ADDREC = 'Y'`), checks `BICUA3` to ensure no existing agreement matches the key fields (company, customer, location, container, unit of measure, ship-to, product codes, PO, min/max quantities, start date/time, freight code) using `otkH102` keylist (`COM(58)` if a duplicate exists).
   - For **update** operations (`ADDREC ≠ 'Y'`), checks `BICUA9` for:
     - An agreement with the new end date/time, ignoring records with start dates after the current end date or end dates not equal to 12/31/2079 23:59 (`COM(58)` if no match).
     - An agreement without an end date/time, ensuring a record exists to update (`COM(58)` if no match).
   - Skips update checks for "copy to other" fields per `jb01`.

5. **Copy to Other Validation (`jb01`)**:
   - Only allows "copy to other" processing (other locations, ship-tos, customer ship-tos) when adding a record (`ADDREC = 'Y'`), either via F6 or option 3 (copy).
   - Protects "copy to other" fields during updates and prevents their modification.
   - Validates "expire" field (`S3EXPR`) only for copy operations (`COM(47)` if not 'Y' during copy).

6. **Program Termination**:
   - Sets `*inlr = *on` and returns, passing back the `CUAGDS` data structure with any error messages (`@MSG`) and cursor positioning (`@PC`).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules to validate customer sales agreement data:

1. **Mandatory Field Validation**:
   - Company (`CONO`) must exist in `BICONT` (`COM(01)`).
   - Customer (`CUST`) must exist in `ARCUST` (`COM(06)`).
   - Location (`ALOC`) must exist in `INLOC` (`COM(20)`).
   - At least one valid product code (`S3PR`) must be entered (`COM(09)`).
   - PO/Order code (`S3POOR`) must be 'P' (purchase order) or 'O' (order) (`COM(36)`).

2. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   - No duplicate product codes (`COM(11)`).
   - No duplicate other locations (`COM(40)`), ship-tos (`COM(43)`), or customer ship-tos (`COM(56)`, `COM(57)`).
   - No duplicate agreements for add operations based on key fields (`COM(58)`).

3. **Container and Product Rules**:
   - Container (`KCNTR`) must be valid in `GSCNTR1` (`COM(33)`) and have a valid type in `GSTABL` (`COM(32)`).
   - Non-fluid products (based on `TPFLCD` in `GSPROD`) must have a blank container (`COM(17)`, `COM(52)`).
   - Fluid products require a valid container (`COM(54)`).
   - Unit of measure (`UNMS`) must be valid in `GSTABL` (`COM(08)`, `COM(50)`).

4. **Date and Time Validation**:
   - Start and end dates (`STDT`, `ENDT`) must be valid (`COM(15)`, `COM(18)`).
   - Start and end times (`STTM`, `ENTM`) must have valid hours (00-23, `COM(21)`, `COM(23)`) and minutes (00-59, `COM(22)`, `COM(24)`).
   - Start and end times cannot be all zeros (`COM(25)`, `COM(26)`).
   - End date/time must follow start date/time (`COM(35)`).
   - Allows same start dates if freight codes (`FRCD`) differ (`MG04`).

5. **Ship-To Rules**:
   - If all ship-tos (`ALSH = 'Y'`), ship-to (`SHIP`) must be zero (`COM(28)`).
   - If not all ship-tos (`ALSH = 'N'`), ship-to must be non-zero and valid in `SHIPTO` (`COM(49)`, `COM(48)`).

6. **Copy to Other Restrictions (`jb01`)**:
   - "Copy to other" fields (other locations, ship-tos, customer ship-tos) are only editable during add operations (F6 or option 3).
   - These fields are protected during updates.
   - The expire field (`S3EXPR`) is only used for copy operations and must be 'Y' (`COM(47)`).

7. **Password Validation**:
   - Agreement password (`KAGPW`) must match `BCAGPW` in `BICONT` (`COM(34)`).
   - A password is required if the start date is more than 3 days in the past (`COM(37)`).

8. **Other Field Rules**:
   - Freight code (`FRCD`) must be 'C', 'P', 'A', or blank (`COM(31)`).
   - Prepaid (`PPD`) must be 'P' or blank (`COM(55)`).
   - Primary flag (`PRIM`) must be 'I' (invoice) or 'M' (month-end) (`COM(29)`).
   - Either price (`PRCE`) or off-price (`OFFP`) must be non-zero (`COM(14)`).
   - Purchase order (`PORD`) must exist in `BBORDH` if `S3POOR = 'O'` (`COM(13)`).

9. **Update Validation**:
   - For updates, ensures an agreement exists with the specified end date/time or no end date/time (`COM(58)`).
   - Ignores records with start dates after the current end date or end dates not equal to 12/31/2079 23:59.

### Tables Used

The program uses the following database files, with overrides applied based on `p$fgrp` ('G' or 'Z'):

1. **BICONT**: Company master file (input, validates `CONO` and `BCAGPW`).
2. **ARCUST**: Customer master file (input, validates `CUST`).
3. **SHIPTO**: Ship-to file (input, validates `SHIP` and customer ship-tos).
4. **INLOC**: Location file (input, validates `ALOC` and other locations).
5. **GSTABL**: Table file (input, validates container type and unit of measure).
6. **GSCNTR1**: Container file (input, validates `KCNTR`, alpha key, replaced `GSCNTR` per `jk06` in `BB943`).
7. **BICUA3**: Sales agreement logical file (input, checks for duplicate agreements during add, includes min/max quantities per `jk02`).
8. **BICUA9**: Sales agreement logical file (input, checks for existing agreements during update, includes min/max quantities per `jk02`).
9. **BBORDH**: Order header file (input, validates purchase order number for `S3POOR = 'O'`).
10. **GSPROD**: Product file (input, validates product codes and fluid/non-fluid status, added per `jk04`).

Overrides map these files to specific libraries (e.g., `gbicont` or `zbicont`).
