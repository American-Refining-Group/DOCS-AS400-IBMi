The provided document is an RPG (Report Program Generator) program named `BB932` for the IBM System/36, called from the OCL program described earlier. This program is designed to print a freight table code file. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and any external programs called, based on the RPG code.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program (BB932)

The RPG program processes data from input files, performs lookups, and generates a formatted report for the freight table. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process steps:

1. **File Definitions**:
   - **Input Files**:
     - `BBFRTB` (Input Primary, Fixed-length 60 bytes): The freight table file containing freight codes, rates, and unit of measure (U/M) data.
     - `BICONT` (Input Full-Procedural, Fixed-length 256 bytes, Indexed): A control file with company information, accessed via a `CHAIN` operation.
     - `GSTABL` (Input Full-Procedural, Fixed-length 256 bytes, Indexed): A general system table, likely containing unit of measure descriptions, accessed via a `CHAIN` operation.
   - **Output File**:
     - `PRINT` (Output, Fixed-length 132 bytes, Printer): The output file for generating the printed freight table report.

2. **Data Structure and Field Definitions**:
   - **BBFRTB Fields**:
     - `BFDEL` (1 char, pos 1): Delete code (likely indicates if the record is marked for deletion).
     - `BFCONO` (2 chars, pos 2-3): Company code (misaligned in comment as pos 2-30; likely a typo).
     - `BFFRCD` (2 chars, pos 4-5): Freight code.
     - `BFRATE` (6 chars, pos 6-11): Freight rate per gallon.
     - `BFFRLB` (6 chars, pos 12-17): Freight rate per pound.
     - `BFFRUM` (3 chars, pos 18-20): Freight rate unit of measure.
     - `BFFRPU` (6 chars, pos 21-26): Freight rate per unit of measure.
   - **BICONT Fields**:
     - `BCNAME` (30 chars, pos 4-33): Company name.
   - **GSTABL Fields**:
     - `TBTYPE` (6 chars, pos 2-7): Table type.
     - `TBCODE` (6 chars, pos 8-13): Table code.
     - `TBDESC` (30 chars, pos 14-43): Table description.
   - **Data Structure**:
     - `KLFRUM` (12 chars): Composite key for `GSTABL` lookup, split into:
       - `K$UNMS` (6 chars): Table type, set to `'BIUNMS'`.
       - `K$FRUM` (6 chars): Table code, populated from `BFFRUM`.
   - **Other Variables**:
     - `W$ONCE` (1 char): Flag to ensure one-time initialization.
     - `TIME12` (12 chars): System time.
     - `TIME` (6 chars): Formatted time.
     - `DATE` (6 chars): Formatted date.
     - `PAGE` (Numeric): Page number for the report.
     - `R$UMDS` (30 chars): Unit of measure description.
     - `ERR` (Array, 1 element, 80 chars): Error message for invalid U/M code.

3. **Initialization (One-Time Setup)**:
   - **Check `W$ONCE` (C-spec, `W$ONCE IFNE 'Y'`)**: Ensures initialization occurs only once.
     - Sets `K$UNMS` to `'BIUNMS'` (table type for unit of measure lookup).
     - Sets `W$ONCE` to `'Y'` to prevent re-execution.
   - This block (`B1`-`E1`) runs once to initialize the lookup key for `GSTABL`.

4. **Main Processing Loop (Level 1, L1)**:
   - **Company Lookup**:
     - For each record in `BBFRTB` (indicator `01`), perform a `CHAIN` operation on `BICONT` using `BFCONO` (company code) to retrieve `BCNAME` (company name).
     - If the lookup fails (indicator `99` on), set `BCNAME` to blanks.
   - **Time and Date Setup**:
     - Retrieve system time into `TIME12` (12 chars).
     - Move `TIME12` to `TIME` (6 chars) and `DATE` (6 chars) for report formatting.
     - Initialize `PAGE` to 0 for pagination.
   - **Record Processing (DO Loop)**:
     - For each `BBFRTB` record (indicator `01`):
       - Clear `R$UMDS` (U/M description) to blanks.
       - If `BFFRUM` (unit of measure) is not blank:
         - Move `BFFRUM` to `K$FRUM` (table code in the key).
         - Perform a `CHAIN` on `GSTABL` using `KLFRUM` (`K$UNMS` + `K$FRUM`) to retrieve `TBDESC` (U/M description).
         - If the lookup succeeds (indicator `98` off), move `TBDESC` to `R$UMDS`.
         - If the lookup fails (indicator `98` on), move error message (`ERR,01`: "INVALID U/M CODE") to `R$UMDS`.

5. **Report Output (OPRINT Specifications)**:
   - **Header Lines (H)**:
     - Printed at level 1 (`L1`) with overflow (`OF`) or no overflow (`NL1`).
     - Line 1: Company name (`BCNAME`, pos 1-30), "PAGE" (pos 104), page number (`PAGE`, pos 108, zero-suppressed), date (`DATE`, pos 120, formatted).
     - Line 2: Report title "* FREIGHT TABLE CODE FILE *" (pos 73-77), time (`TIME`, pos 120, formatted as "HH.MM.SS").
   - **Detail Lines (D)**:
     - Printed at level 1 (`L1`) with overflow (`OF`) or no overflow (`NL1`).
     - Separator lines with asterisks (pos 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 132).
     - Column headers:
       - "FREIGHT TABLE CODE" (pos 10)
       - "FREIGHT RATE PER GAL" (pos 22)
       - "FREIGHT RATE PER LBS" (pos 35)
       - "U/M" (pos 39)
       - "U/M DESCRIPTION" (pos 55)
       - "FREIGHT RATE PER U/M" (pos 84)
   - **Data Lines (D, Indicator 01)**:
     - Printed for each `BBFRTB` record (indicator `01`).
     - Fields:
       - `BFDEL` (pos 1): Delete code.
       - `BFFRCD` (pos 8): Freight code.
       - `BFRATE` (pos 21): Freight rate per gallon (likely reformatted as `BFRATE3` for output).
       - `BFFRLB` (pos 34): Freight rate per pound (likely reformatted as `BFFRLB3`).
       - `BFFRUM` (pos 39): Unit of measure.
       - `R$UMDS` (pos 70): Unit of measure description.
       - `BFFRPU` (pos 83): Freight rate per unit of measure (likely reformatted as `BFFRPU3`).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules:
1. **Company Name Lookup**:
   - For each freight table record, the program retrieves the company name from `BICONT` using the company code (`BFCONO`). If no match is found, the company name is blank.
2. **Unit of Measure Validation**:
   - If a freight record has a non-blank unit of measure (`BFFRUM`), the program looks up its description in `GSTABL` using the composite key (`K$UNMS='BIUNMS'`, `K$FRUM=BFFRUM`).
   - If the lookup fails, an error message ("INVALID U/M CODE") is displayed in the report.
3. **Report Formatting**:
   - The report includes a header with company name, page number, date, and time.
   - Freight data is organized by code, rates (per gallon, pound, and unit of measure), and unit of measure description.
   - Records marked with a delete code (`BFDEL`) are included in the report, allowing visibility of potentially inactive records.
4. **Pagination**:
   - The program tracks page numbers (`PAGE`) and includes them in the header.
   - Overflow handling ensures proper formatting across pages.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program uses the following files:
1. **BBFRTB** (Input Primary):
   - Purpose: Contains freight table data (codes, rates, units of measure).
   - Fields: `BFDEL`, `BFCONO`, `BFFRCD`, `BFRATE`, `BFFRLB`, `BFFRUM`, `BFFRPU`.
2. **BICONT** (Input Full-Procedural, Indexed):
   - Purpose: Stores company information.
   - Field: `BCNAME` (company name).
3. **GSTABL** (Input Full-Procedural, Indexed):
   - Purpose: Stores unit of measure descriptions.
   - Fields: `TBTYPE`, `TBCODE`, `TBDESC`.
4. **PRINT** (Output):
   - Purpose: Printer file for generating the freight table report.

### External Programs Called

- **None**: The RPG program does not explicitly call any external programs (e.g., via `CALL` operations). It operates self-contained, relying on file I/O and internal logic.

### Additional Notes
- **Field Formatting**: The output fields `BFRATE3`, `BFFRLB3`, and `BFFRPU3` suggest reformatted versions of `BFRATE`, `BFFRLB`, and `BFFRPU` (likely with decimal places or specific formatting), but the RPG code does not show explicit conversion. This might be handled implicitly by RPG or defined elsewhere.
- **Error Handling**: The program handles invalid unit of measure codes gracefully by outputting an error message in the report.
- **System/36 Context**: The program assumes a System/36 environment with specific file structures and indexing. The `?9?` labels from the OCL are not reflected in the RPG but are likely resolved at runtime.
- **Potential Enhancements**: If you have additional code (e.g., for field formatting or subroutines), I can provide a more detailed analysis. If you need clarification on specific RPG operations or System/36 behavior, let me know!

### Summary
- **Process Steps**: Initialize lookup key, read freight table records, lookup company name and unit of measure descriptions, format and print a report with headers and data lines.
- **Business Rules**: Lookup company names, validate unit of measures, include delete codes, and format reports with pagination.
- **Tables Used**: `BBFRTB` (freight data), `BICONT` (company data), `GSTABL` (U/M descriptions), `PRINT` (output).
- **External Programs**: None.
