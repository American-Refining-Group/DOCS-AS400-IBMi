The RPG program `BB910.rpgle` is designed for National Diesel Fuel Index maintenance and inquiry within the Bradford Order Entry/Invoices system. It is called by `BB912.rpgle` to manage records related to the National Diesel Fuel Index, which tracks diesel fuel prices by region, effective date, and time. The program uses two subfiles (`SFL1` for header records and `SFL2` for detail records) to display and manage these records, allowing users to view, add, update, or delete entries. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of `BB910.rpgle`

The program operates through a series of subroutines that handle the display and processing of National Diesel Fuel Index records. The main steps are:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Receives Input Parameters**:
     - `a$co`: Company number.
     - `p$mode`: Run mode ('MNT' for maintenance, 'INQ' for inquiry).
     - `p$fgrp`: File group ('Z' or 'G' for library selection).
   - Sets global protection mode (`*in70`) based on `p$mode`:
     - `MNT`: Allows editing (`*in70 = *off`).
     - `INQ`: Read-only mode (`*in70 = *on`).
   - Initializes subfile control fields (`rrn1`, `rrn2`, `pagsz1`, `pagsz2`), message handling fields, and key lists for file access.
   - Sets the current date and time (`ps#dat`, `ps#cen`, `ps#ymd`, `t#hms`) for validation and history logging.
   - Moves input parameters to control fields (`c1co`) and sets the header (`c$hdr1`) to "National Diesel Fuel Index Maintenance" or "Inquiry" based on mode.
   - Defines key lists (`kls1s1`, `kls1r1`, `klnxt1`, `klsfl1`, `kls2a1`, `kls2a2`, `kls2r1`, `kls2r2`, `klsfl2`, `klregn`) for file access.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - Applies file overrides based on `p$fgrp` ('Z' or 'G') to select the appropriate library for files.
   - Opens input files (`bicont`, `gstabl`, `bbndfi1`, `bbndfird`) and update/output files (`bbndfi`, `bbndfih`).

3. **Process Subfile 1 (`srsfl1` Subroutine)**:
   - Clears the message subfile (`clrmsg`) and writes it (`wrtmsg`).
   - Sets a default company value (`c1co = 10`) if not provided.
   - Positions the file cursor (`sf1rep`) to load header records into `SFL1`.
   - Enters a main loop (`sf1agn`) to display and process `SFL1`:
     - Writes the command line (`sflcmd1`).
     - Displays the message subfile if errors exist (`wrtmsg`).
     - Checks for existing subfile records to enable/disable display (`*in41` for `SFLDSP`).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules to ensure data integrity and proper management of National Diesel Fuel Index records:
1. **Validation of Key Fields**:
   - Company (`c1co`) must exist in `bicont`.
   - Region (`c2regn`) must exist in `gstabl` with type `BBNDFI`.
   - Effective Date (`c1emdy`, `c2efdt`) must be in valid MMDDYY format, validated by `GSDTEDIT`.
   - Effective Time (`c2eftm`) must be in valid HHMM format.

2. **Deletion Handling**:
   - Header and detail records can be marked as deleted (`bndel = 'D'`) or reactivated.
   - Deletion actions are logged in the history file (`bbndfih`).

3. **Mode-Based Protection**:
   - In inquiry mode (`p$mode = 'INQ'`), all fields are protected (`*in70`, `*in71`).
   - In maintenance mode (`p$mode = 'MNT'`), fields are editable, with validation enforced.

4. **History Tracking**:
   - All add, update, copy, and delete operations on header and detail records (`bbndfi`) are logged to `bbndfih` with user ID, timestamp, and record data.

5. **Subfile Navigation**:
   - `SFL1` displays header records (company, effective date, effective time).
   - `SFL2` displays detail records (region, retail price) for a selected header.
   - Users can navigate between subfiles using options (e.g., option 6 to access details).

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors (e.g., invalid region or date format) are displayed in the message subfile with specific messages (e.g., "Invalid Region").
   - The first display suppresses errors to avoid overwhelming the user (`w$frst`).

7. **Display Modes**:
   - F06 toggles between "Review Mode" (filtered records) and "All Mode" (all records), affecting which records are loaded into `SFL1`.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program accesses the following files, with overrides applied based on `p$fgrp` ('Z' or 'G'):
1. **bb910d**: Display file (workstation file with subfiles `SFL1` and `SFL2`, and message subfile).
2. **bicont**: Company master file (input only).
3. **gstabl**: Table file for region codes (input only).
4. **bbndfi**: National Diesel Fuel Index file (update and add).
5. **bbndfi1**: National Diesel Fuel Index file (input only, renamed record format `bbndfi1r`).
6. **bbndfird**: National Diesel Fuel Index file (input only, renamed record format `bbndfi2r`).
7. **bbndfih**: National Diesel Fuel Index history file (output only).

---

### External Programs Called

The program interacts with the following external programs:
1. **GB730P**: Displays history inquiry for header records.
2. **QMHSNDPM**: Sends messages to the program message queue.
3. **QMHRMVPM**: Removes messages from the program message queue.
4. **QCMDEXC**: Executes file override commands.
5. **GSDTEDIT**: Validates dates (called via `pldted` parameter list).

### Summary

The `BB910.rpgle` program, called by `BB912.rpgle`, provides a robust interface for managing National Diesel Fuel Index records. It uses two subfiles: `SFL1` for header records (company, effective date, effective time) and `SFL2` for detail records (region, retail price). The program supports adding, updating, copying, deleting, and inquiring about records, with strict validation of company, region, date, and time fields. All changes are logged to the history file (`bbndfih`), and the program integrates with external programs for history inquiry and date validation. The lack of revisions since the initial creation suggests stability, with the core functionality focused on maintaining accurate diesel fuel price data by region.
