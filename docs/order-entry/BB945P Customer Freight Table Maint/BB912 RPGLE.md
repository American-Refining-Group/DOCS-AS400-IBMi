The RPG program `BB912.rpgle` is designed for carrier fuel surcharge maintenance and inquiry within the Bradford Order Entry/Invoices system. It is called by `BB945.rpgle` to manage fuel surcharge records for specific carriers, allowing users to view, add, update, or delete surcharge entries. The program uses two subfiles (`SFL1` for header records and `SFL2` for detail records) to display and manage carrier fuel surcharge data. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of `BB912.rpgle`

The program operates through a series of subroutines that handle the display and processing of carrier fuel surcharge records. The main steps are:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Receives Input Parameters**:
     - `a$co`: Company number.
     - `p$caid`: Carrier ID.
     - `p$mode`: Run mode ('MNT' for maintenance, 'INQ' for inquiry).
     - `p$fgrp`: File group ('Z' or 'G' for library selection).
   - Sets global protection mode (`*in70`) based on `p$mode`:
     - `MNT`: Allows editing (`*in70 = *off`).
     - `INQ`: Read-only mode (`*in70 = *on`).
   - Initializes subfile control fields (`rrn1`, `rrn2`, `pagsz1`, `pagsz2`), message handling fields, and key lists for file access.
   - Sets the current date and time (`ps#dat`, `ps#cen`, `ps#ymd`) for validation and history logging.
   - Moves input parameters to control fields (`c1co`, `c1caid`) and sets the header based on mode (`c$hdr1` = "Carrier Fuel Surcharge Maintenance" or "Inquiry").
   - Defines key lists (`kls1s1`, `kls1r1`, `klsfl1`, `kls2s1`, `kls2r1`, `klsfl2`, `klregn`, `klcaid`, `klcpy1`, `klcpy2`) for file access.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - Applies file overrides based on `p$fgrp` ('Z' or 'G') to select the appropriate library for files.
   - Opens input files (`bicont`, `gstabl`, `bbcaid`, `bbcfsh1`, `bbcfsdrd`) and update/output files (`bbcfsh`, `bbcfsd`, `bbcfshh`, `bbcfsdh`).

3. **Process Subfile 1 (`srsfl1` Subroutine)**:
   - Clears the message subfile (`clrmsg`) and writes it (`wrtmsg`).
   - Positions the file cursor (`sf1rep`) to load header records into `SFL1`.
   - Enters a main loop (`sf1agn`) to display and process `SFL1`:
     - Writes the command line (`sflcmd1`).
     - Displays the message subfile if errors exist (`wrtmsg`).
     - Checks for existing subfile records to enable/disable display (`*in41` for `SFLDSP`).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules to ensure data integrity and proper fuel surcharge management:
1. **Validation of Key Fields**:
   - Company (`c1co`) must exist in `bicont`.
   - Carrier ID (`c1caid`) must exist in `bbcaid` or be "##" (all carriers).
   - Effective Date (`c1emdy`, `c2emdy`) must be in valid MMDDYY format, validated by `GSDTEDIT`.

2. **Percentage Range Validation**:
   - In `SFL2`, the "To Price" (`s2topc`) must not be less than the "From Price" (`s2frpc`).
   - Percentage ranges must not conflict with existing entries for the same header (company, carrier ID, effective date).
   - Fuel surcharge percentage (`s2fspc`) must be non-negative and consistent with existing entries.

3. **Deletion Handling**:
   - Header and detail records can be marked as deleted (`bjdel = 'D'`, `bkdel = 'D'`) or reactivated.
   - Deletion actions (via F23) are logged in history files (`bbcfshh`, `bbcfsdh`).

4. **Mode-Based Protection**:
   - In inquiry mode (`p$mode = 'INQ'`), all fields are protected (`*in70`, `*in71`).
   - In maintenance mode (`p$mode = 'MNT'`), fields are editable, with validation enforced.

5. **History Tracking**:
   - All add, update, copy, and delete operations on header (`bbcfsh`) and detail (`bbcfsd`) records are logged to `bbcfshh` and `bbcfsdh`, respectively, with user ID and timestamp.

6. **Subfile Navigation**:
   - `SFL1` displays header records (company, carrier ID, effective date, region).
   - `SFL2` displays detail records (fuel surcharge percentages and price ranges) for a selected header.
   - Users can navigate between subfiles using options (e.g., option 6 to access details).

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors (e.g., invalid carrier, date format, or percentage conflicts) are displayed in the message subfile with specific error messages (e.g., "To Price Cannot Be Less Than From Price").
   - The first display suppresses errors to avoid overwhelming the user (`w$frst`).

The program accesses the following files, with overrides applied based on `p$fgrp` ('Z' or 'G'):
1. **bb912d**: Display file (workstation file with subfiles `SFL1` and `SFL2`, and message subfile).
2. **bicont**: Company master file (input only).
3. **gstabl**: Table file for region codes (input only).
4. **bbcaid**: Carrier ID file (input only).

### External Programs Called

The program interacts with the following external programs:
1. **LBBCAID**: Prompts for carrier ID selection.
2. **BB910**: Manages National Diesel Fuel Index maintenance/inquiry.
3. **GB730P**: Displays history inquiry for header records.
4. **QMHSNDPM**: Sends messages to the program message queue.

### Summary

The `BB912.rpgle` program, called by `BB945.rpgle`, provides a robust interface for managing carrier fuel surcharge records. It uses two subfiles: `SFL1` for header records (company, carrier ID, effective date, region) and `SFL2` for detail records (fuel surcharge percentages and price ranges). The program supports adding, updating, copying, deleting, and inquiring about surcharge records, with strict validation of fields and percentage ranges. It logs all changes to history files (`bbcfshh`, `bbcfsdh`) and integrates with external programs for prompting, history inquiry, and date validation. The revisions indicate enhancements like history tracking and replacing older carrier lookup logic with `LBBCAID`.
