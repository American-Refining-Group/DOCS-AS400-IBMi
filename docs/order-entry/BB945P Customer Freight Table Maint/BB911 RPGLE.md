The RPG program `BB911.rpgle` is designed for Railcar Fuel Index maintenance and inquiry within the Bradford Order Entry/Invoices system. It is called by `BB945.rpgle` to manage records related to the Railcar Fuel Index, which tracks fuel surcharge data for railcar carriers based on company, effective date, and retail price. The program uses two subfiles (`SFL1` for header records and `SFL2` for detail records) to display and manage these records, allowing users to view, add, update, or delete entries. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called.

### Process Steps of `BB911.rpgle`

The program operates through a series of subroutines that handle the display and processing of Railcar Fuel Index records. The main steps are:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Receives Input Parameters**:
     - `a$co`: Company number.
     - `p$mode`: Run mode ('MNT' for maintenance, 'INQ' for inquiry).
     - `p$fgrp`: File group ('Z' or 'G' for library selection).
   - Sets global protection mode (`*in70`) based on `p$mode`:
     - `MNT`: Allows editing (`*in70 = *off`).
     - `INQ`: Read-only mode (`*in70 = *on`).
   - Initializes subfile control fields (`rrn1`, `rrn2`, `pagsz1`, `pagsz2`), message handling fields, and key lists for file access.
   - Sets the current date and time (`ps#dat`, `ps#cen`, `ps#ymd`, `t#hms`) for validation and history logging.
   - Moves input parameters to control fields (`c1co`) and sets the header (`c$hdr1`) to "Railcar Fuel Index Maintenance" or "Inquiry" based on mode.
   - Defines key lists (`kls1s1`, `kls1r1`, `klnxt1`, `klsfl1`, `kls2r1`, `kls2r2`, `klsfl2`) for file access.
   - Suppresses errors on the first display (`w$frst`).

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - Applies file overrides based on `p$fgrp` ('Z' or 'G') to select the appropriate library for files.
   - Opens input files (`bicont`, `gstabl`, `bbrcsc1`, `bbrcscrd`) and update/output files (`bbrcsc`, `bbrcsch`).

3. **Process Subfile 1 (`srsfl1` Subroutine)**:
   - Clears the message subfile (`clrmsg`) and writes it (`wrtmsg`).
   - Sets a default company value (`c1co = 10`) if not provided.
   - Positions the file cursor (`sf1rep`) to load header records into `SFL1`.
   - Enters a main loop (`sf1agn`) to display and process `SFL1`:
     - Writes the command line (`sflcmd1`).
     - Displays the message subfile if errors exist (`wrtmsg`).
     - Checks for existing subfile records to enable/disable display (`*in41` for `SFLDSP`).
     - Displays the subfile control format (`sflctl1`) using `EXFMT`.
     - Processes user input:

       - **F05**: Refreshes the subfile, clearing positioning fields (`r$emdy`, `c1emdy`, `d1opt`, `d1emdy`, `d1eftm`, `c1rprc`, `r$rprc`).
       - **F06**: Toggles between "Review Mode" and "All Mode" (`s1f06`), controlling which records are displayed.

       - **Direct Access**: Processes direct input options (`sf1dir`) if `d1opt`, `d1emdy`, or `d1eftm` is non-zero.
       - **Page Down**: Loads additional subfile records (`sf1lod`).
       - **Enter**: Processes subfile changes (`sf1prc`).
     - Handles user repositioning requests by checking control fields (`c1co`, `c1emdy`, `c1rprc`) and repositioning if needed (`sf1rep`).

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules to ensure data integrity and proper management of Railcar Fuel Index records:
1. **Validation of Key Fields**:
   - Company (`c1co`) must exist in `bicont`.
   - Effective Date (`c1emdy`, `c2efdt`) must be in valid MMDDYY format, validated by `GSDTEDIT`.
   - Effective Time (`c2eftm`) must be in valid HHMM format.
   - Retail Price (`c1rprc`, `s2rprc`) must be non-negative.

2. **Deletion Handling**:
   - Header and detail records can be marked as deleted (`bndel = 'D'`) or reactivated.
   - Deletion actions are logged in the history file (`bbrcsch`).

3. **Mode-Based Protection**:
   - In inquiry mode (`p$mode = 'INQ'`), all fields are protected (`*in70`, `*in71`).
   - In maintenance mode (`p$mode = 'MNT'`), fields are editable, with validation enforced.

4. **History Tracking**:
   - All add, update, copy, and delete operations on header and detail records (`bbrcsc`) are logged to `bbrcsch` with user ID, timestamp, and record data.

5. **Subfile Navigation**:
   - `SFL1` displays header records (company, effective date, effective time, retail price).
   - `SFL2` displays detail records (retail price) for a selected header.
   - Users can navigate between subfiles using options (e.g., option 6 to access details).

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors (e.g., invalid date or price) are displayed in the message subfile with specific messages (e.g., "Invalid Region").
   - The first display suppresses errors to avoid overwhelming the user (`w$frst`).
   - Revision JK02 (08/05/18) ensures error indicators are properly reset to avoid false error displays.

7. **Display Modes**:
   - F06 toggles between "Review Mode" (filtered records) and "All Mode" (all records), affecting which records are loaded into `SFL1`.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program accesses the following files, with overrides applied based on `p$fgrp` ('Z' or 'G'):
1. **bb911d**: Display file (workstation file with subfiles `SFL1` and `SFL2`, and message subfile).
2. **bicont**: Company master file (input only).
3. **gstabl**: Table file for validation (input only).
4. **bbrcsc**: Railcar Fuel Index file (update and add).
5. **bbrcsc1**: Railcar Fuel Index file (input only, renamed record format `bbrcsc1r`).
6. **bbrcscrd**: Railcar Fuel Index file (input only, renamed record format `bbrcsc2r`).
7. **bbrcsch**: Railcar Fuel Index history file (output only).

---

### External Programs Called

The program interacts with the following external programs:
1. **GB730P**: Displays history inquiry for header records.
2. **QMHSNDPM**: Sends messages to the program message queue.
3. **QMHRMVPM**: Removes messages from the program message queue.
4. **QCMDEXC**: Executes file override commands.
5. **GSDTEDIT**: Validates dates (called via `pldted` parameter list).

### Summary

The `BB911.rpgle` program, called by `BB945.rpgle`, provides an interface for managing Railcar Fuel Index records, specifically for railcar carriers. It uses two subfiles: `SFL1` for header records (company, effective date, effective time, retail price) and `SFL2` for detail records (retail price). The program supports adding, updating, copying, deleting, and inquiring about records, with strict validation of company, date, time, and price fields. All changes are logged to the history file (`bbrcsch`), and the program integrates with external programs for history inquiry and date validation. The revision (JK02, 08/05/18) addresses error indicator handling for improved user experience.
