The `MINLBGL1.rpgle` is an RPGLE program (converted from RPG, as implied by its structure and the use of `/FREE` syntax) called from the `BB502.ocl36.txt` OCL program or other programs like `BB110` and `MBBQTY` (as referenced in `MBBQTY.rpgle.txt`). It is a utility module designed to convert between pounds (`KYLBS`) and net gallons (`KYGAL`) using the API gravity (`KYGRAV`) based on a standardized formula. Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called based on the provided RPG source code.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

The `MINLBGL1` program converts between pounds and net gallons using two subroutines: `LBGL11` (pounds to gallons) and `GLLB11` (gallons to pounds). It also includes a legacy subroutine (`CALC`) for calculating a conversion factor, though this appears deprecated in favor of the updated formula (JB01). Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - The program defines input and output parameters via a parameter list (`*ENTRY PLIST`):
     - `KYGRAV` (3-digit signed decimal with 1 decimal place, API gravity).
     - `KYLBS` (7-digit signed integer, pounds, input/output).
     - `KYGAL` (7-digit signed integer, net gallons, input/output).
     - `KYFACT` (7-digit signed decimal with 3 decimal places, conversion factor, commented out per JB01).
   - Work fields are defined for calculations:
     - `w@wrk1` (12-digit, 10 decimal places): Intermediate specific gravity calculation.
     - `w@wrk2` (15-digit, 10 decimal places): Intermediate factor calculation.
     - `w@LBS` (15-digit integer): Temporary pounds result.
     - `w@GAL` (15-digit integer): Temporary gallons result.
   - The legacy `CALC` subroutine uses additional work fields: `WRK62` (6-digit, 2 decimal places) and `WRK73` (7-digit, 3 decimal places).

2. **Input Validation and Subroutine Selection**:
   - The program checks the input parameters:
     - If `KYLBS` is non-zero, it calls the `LBGL11` subroutine to convert pounds to net gallons (JB01).
     - If `KYGAL` is non-zero, it calls the `GLLB11` subroutine to convert net gallons to pounds (JB01).
     - If neither condition is met, it falls back to the legacy `CALC` subroutine (though this is likely unused due to the `1 ifne 1` condition, which is always false).

3. **Pounds to Gallons Conversion (`LBGL11` Subroutine)**:
   - The subroutine uses the API standard formula (JB01):
     - Calculate specific gravity: `w@wrk1 = 141.5 / (131.5 + KYGRAV)`.
     - Calculate factor: `w@wrk2 = w@wrk1 * 999.01599999999996`.
     - Calculate net gallons: `w@gal = KYLBS / w@wrk2 * 119.8`.
   - The result (`w@gal`) is moved to `KYGAL` for output.
   - Calculations are performed in `/FREE` syntax for precision (high-precision work fields like `w@wrk1` and `w@wrk2`).

4. **Gallons to Pounds Conversion (`GLLB11` Subroutine)**:
   - The subroutine uses the inverse API standard formula (JB01):
     - Calculate specific gravity: `w@wrk1 = 141.5 / (131.5 + KYGRAV)`.
     - Calculate factor: `w@wrk2 = w@wrk1 * 999.01599999999996`.
     - Calculate pounds: `w@lbs = KYGAL * w@wrk2 / 119.8`.
   - The result (`w@lbs`) is moved to `KYLBS` for output.

5. **Legacy Conversion Factor Calculation (`CALC` Subroutine)**:
   - This subroutine (likely deprecated per JB01) calculates a conversion factor (`KYFACT`) using an older formula:
     - Calculate denominator: `WRK62 = 131.5 + KYGRAV`.
     - Calculate specific gravity: `WRK73 = 141.5 / WRK62`.
     - Calculate factor: `KYFACT = WRK73 * 8.337193` (density in pounds per gallon).
   - This factor was used for conversions (pounds / factor = gallons, gallons * factor = pounds) but is no longer used in favor of direct calculations in `LBGL11` and `GLLB11`.

6. **Program Termination**:
   - The program sets the `LR` (Last Record) indicator and returns the updated `KYLBS` or `KYGAL` to the calling program via the parameter list.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules, based on the code and change history:

1. **API Standard Formula (JB01)**:
   - The program uses the API standard formula for converting between pounds and net gallons:
     - Pounds to gallons: `Gallons = Pounds / ((141.5 / (131.5 + Gravity)) * 999.01599999999996) * 119.8`.
     - Gallons to pounds: `Pounds = Gallons * ((141.5 / (131.5 + Gravity)) * 999.01599999999996) / 119.8`.
   - This replaces the older formula (used in `CALC`) to ensure accuracy per API standards.

2. **Input-Driven Conversion**:
   - If `KYLBS` is non-zero, the program converts pounds to net gallons.
   - If `KYGAL` is non-zero, the program converts net gallons to pounds.
   - The program assumes only one of `KYLBS` or `KYGAL` is provided as input to avoid ambiguity.

3. **Precision in Calculations**:
   - High-precision work fields (`w@wrk1`, `w@wrk2`, `w@LBS`, `w@GAL`) ensure accurate results, with `w@wrk1` and `w@wrk2` using 10 decimal places for intermediate calculations.
   - The constants `999.01599999999996` and `119.8` are used to align with API standards.

4. **Legacy Code Handling**:
   - The `CALC` subroutine, which computes a conversion factor (`KYFACT`), is included but likely unused due to the `1 ifne 1` condition (always false) and the revision in JB01 favoring direct calculations.

5. **No Database Access**:
   - The program relies entirely on input parameters (`KYGRAV`, `KYLBS`, `KYGAL`) and does not access any database files, making it a pure calculation module.

6. **No Error Handling**:
   - The program does not explicitly check for invalid inputs (e.g., negative gravity or zero values), assuming the calling program validates inputs.

### Tables (Files) Used

The program does not use any database files. It is a standalone calculation module that operates solely on input parameters and internal variables.

---

### External Programs Called

The program does not call any external programs. It performs all calculations internally using the `LBGL11`, `GLLB11`, and `CALC` subroutines.

---

### Summary

The `MINLBGL1` RPGLE program is a utility called from `BB502`, `MBBQTY`, or other programs like `BB110` to convert between pounds (`KYLBS`) and net gallons (`KYGAL`) using the API gravity (`KYGRAV`). It implements the API standard formula (JB01) for accurate conversions, using subroutines `LBGL11` (pounds to gallons) and `GLLB11` (gallons to pounds). The legacy `CALC` subroutine for computing a conversion factor is likely deprecated. The program uses no database files or external programs, relying on high-precision internal calculations to return results to the calling program.
