The `MINT6D.rpgle.txt` is an RPGLE program (converted from RPG, as implied by its structure and comments) called from the `BB502.ocl36.txt` OCL program or other programs like `IN080`. It is a utility module designed to calculate the Table 6D factor (`T6DFAC`) used to convert gross quantities to net quantities (and vice versa) based on temperature (`T6DTEM`), gravity (`T6DGRA`), and volume correction factor code (`T6DVCF`). Below, I’ll explain the process steps, business rules, tables used, and external programs called based on the provided RPG source code.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program

The `MINT6D` program calculates the Table 6D factor (`T6DFAC`) for converting gross gallons to net gallons (or vice versa) using a mathematical formula based on temperature, gravity, and predefined VCF (Volume Correction Factor) codes. It does not access any database files, relying solely on input parameters and internal calculations. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Program Initialization**:
   - The program defines input parameters via a parameter list (`*ENTRY PLIST`):
     - `T6DTEM` (3-digit signed integer, temperature).
     - `T6DGRA` (3-digit signed decimal with 1 decimal place, gravity).
     - `T6DVCF` (2-character, VCF code).
     - `T6DFAC` (6-digit signed decimal with 5 decimal places, output factor).
   - Additional variables are defined for calculations:
     - `K0`, `K1` (10-digit, 4 decimal places), `K2` (10-digit, 8 decimal places): Constants for VCF-based calculations.
     - `P3`, `KX`, `DIF`, `DIFX`, `X1`, `X3`, `E`, `EXSUM`: Intermediate variables for the formula.
   - A debug flag (`printbugs`) is set to `'N'` to disable debug output (commented-out printer file `sysprt`).

2. **Execute Table 6D Subroutine (`TABL6D`)**:
   - The program immediately calls the `TABL6D` subroutine to perform the factor calculation.

3. **VCF Code and Temperature Checks**:
   - If the temperature (`T6DTEM`) is exactly 60°F, the factor (`T6DFAC`) is set to `1.000` and the program jumps to `T6DEND` (JB02).
   - If the VCF code (`T6DVCF`) is blank or `'NA'` (not applicable), the factor is set to `1.000` and the program jumps to `T6DEND` (JB01, line 0070).
   - For valid VCF codes, the program assigns values to `K0`, `K1`, and `K2` based on the VCF code:
     - `'CR'` (Crude Oil): `K0 = 341.0957`, `K1 = 0.0`, `K2 = 0.0`.
     - `'FO'` (Fuel Oil): `K0 = 103.8720`, `K1 = 0.2701`, `K2 = 0.0`.
     - `'JF'` (Jet Fuel): `K0 = 330.3010`, `K1 = 0.0`, `K2 = 0.0`.
     - `'TZ'` (Transition Zone): `K0 = 1489.0670`, `K1 = 0.0`, `K2 = -0.00186840`.
     - `'GA'` (Gasoline): `K0 = 192.4571`, `K1 = 0.2438`, `K2 = 0.0`.
     - `'LU'` (Lubricating Oil): `K0 = 0.0`, `K1 = 0.34878`, `K2 = 0.0`.
   - If the VCF code is invalid (not listed above), the factor is set to `0.0` (line 0067).

4. **Calculate Intermediate Values**:
   - If a valid VCF code is found, the program jumps to the `K0K1` tag and performs calculations:
     - Calculate `P3` using the formula: `P3 = (141.5 * 999.016) / (T6DGRA + 131.5)` (line 0041, using `/FREE` syntax).
     - Calculate `KX` using: `KX = ((K0 / P3) + K1) / P3 + K2` (line 0072, using `/FREE` syntax).
     - Calculate temperature difference: `DIF = T6DTEM - 60.0068749` and `DIFX = DIF + 0.013749795` (line 0087).
     - Calculate `X1`: `X1 = KX * DIF` (line 0088).
     - Calculate `X3`: `X3 = X1 * (1 + (0.8 * KX * DIFX))` (line 0089, using `/FREE` syntax).
     - Calculate `E`: `E = -X3` (line 0092).

5. **Calculate Exponential Sum (`EXSUM`)**:
   - The program computes the exponential of `E` using a Taylor series approximation for `exp(E)` up to 10 terms:
     - `EXSUM = 1 + E + (E²/2) + (E³/6) + (E⁴/24) + (E⁵/120) + (E⁶/720) + (E⁷/5040) + (E⁸/40320) + (E⁹/362880) + (E¹⁰/3628800)` (line 0093, using `/FREE` syntax).
   - The result is stored in `EXSUM`.

6. **Set Output Factor**:
   - The factor `T6DFAC` is set to `EXSUM` (line 0110).
   - The program jumps to the `T6DEND` tag to complete the subroutine.

7. **Program Termination**:
   - The program sets the `LR` (Last Record) indicator and returns the `T6DFAC` value to the calling program via the parameter list.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules, based on the code and change history:

1. **Default Factor for Non-Temperature-Corrected Products (JB01)**:
   - If the VCF code (`T6DVCF`) is blank, indicating the product does not require temperature correction, the factor (`T6DFAC`) is set to `1.000`.

2. **Standard Temperature Rule (JB02)**:
   - If the temperature (`T6DTEM`) is exactly 60°F, the factor is set to `1.000`, as no correction is needed at the standard temperature.

3. **VCF Code-Based Calculations**:
   - The program supports specific VCF codes (`CR`, `FO`, `JF`, `TZ`, `GA`, `LU`, `NA`) with predefined constants (`K0`, `K1`, `K2`) for accurate volume correction based on product type (e.g., crude oil, fuel oil, gasoline).
   - Invalid or unrecognized VCF codes result in a factor of `0.0`, indicating a calculation failure.

4. **Precision in Calculations**:
   - The program uses high-precision variables (e.g., `T6DFAC` as 6S 5, `KX` as 10S 8) to ensure accurate volume corrections.
   - The exponential calculation uses a 10-term Taylor series for precision (line 0093).

5. **No Database Access**:
   - The program relies entirely on input parameters (`T6DTEM`, `T6DGRA`, `T6DVCF`) and does not access any database files, making it a pure calculation module.

6. **Debug Output**:
   - Debug output to a printer file (`sysprt`) is commented out but can be enabled by setting `printbugs = 'Y'`, logging intermediate values (`P3`, `K0`, `K1`, `K2`, `KX`, `DIF`, `DIFX`, `X1`, `X3`, `E`, `EXSUM`, `T6DFAC`).

### Tables (Files) Used

The program does not use any database files. The commented-out `sysprt` printer file (132 bytes) is defined for potential debug output but is not active in the provided code.

---

### External Programs Called

The program does not call any external programs. It is a standalone calculation module that performs all computations internally.

### Summary

The `MINT6D` RPGLE program is a utility called from `BB502` or other programs like `IN080` to calculate the Table 6D factor (`T6DFAC`) for converting gross to net quantities (or vice versa) based on temperature (`T6DTEM`), gravity (`T6DGRA`), and VCF code (`T6DVCF`). It uses predefined constants (`K0`, `K1`, `K2`) for specific product types and a Taylor series approximation for exponential calculations. The program enforces rules for default factors (e.g., `1.000` for blank VCF or 60°F) and handles invalid VCF codes by returning `0.0`. It uses no database files or external programs, relying solely on input parameters and internal math.
