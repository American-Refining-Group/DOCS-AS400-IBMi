The RPG program `BB9059` is a component of the Accounts Payable system, designed to capture a "replacing" carrier ID when creating a new carrier ID, specifically to populate the `bbfx62w` file with "From" and "To" carrier IDs. It is called by the `BB905` program to handle this specific task. Below is a detailed explanation of the process steps, business rules, database tables used, and external programs called, based on the provided source code.

### Process Steps of the RPG Program `BB9059`

The `BB9059` program manages the entry of a replacement carrier ID through a display window (`rplwdw`) and validates the input before updating the `bbfx62w` file. It ensures the "From" carrier ID is valid and not linked to a vendor, then sends confirmation messages to specific users. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization (`*inzsr` Subroutine)**:
   - **Receive Input Parameters**: The program accepts four parameters:
     - `p$co`: Company number.
     - `p$caid`: Carrier ID (the "To" carrier ID, representing the new carrier).
     - `p$flag`: Return code (`1` for successful update, `2` for cancellation).
     - `p$fgrp`: File group (`Z` or `G` for database overrides).
   - **Initialize Format Fields**: Copies `p$co` to `w$co` and `p$caid` to `w$cito` (the "To" carrier ID field for the display window).
   - **Set Up Variables**: Initializes message handling fields (`dspmsg`, `m@pgmq`, `m@key`), and defines key lists:
     - `kltocaid`: For chaining to `bbcaid` with `w$co` and `w$cito` (To carrier).
     - `klfrcaid`: For chaining to `bbcaid` with `w$co` and `w$cifr` (From carrier).
     - `klapveny`: For checking `apveny` with `w$co` and `w$cifr`.
   - **Set Window Flag**: Sets `winagn` to `*on` to enter the window processing loop.

2. **Open Database Tables (`opntbl` Subroutine)**:
   - **Apply File Overrides**: Based on `p$fgrp` (`Z` or `G`), executes override commands (`ovrdbf`) using `QCMDEXC` to point to the appropriate database files (`gapveny`, `gbbcaid`, `gbbfx62w` or `zapveny`, `zbbcaid`, `zbbfx62w`).
     - Loops through three override commands (`ovg` or `ovz`) for each file.
   - **Open Files**: Opens `apveny` (input-only for vendor data), `bbcaid` (input-only for carrier data), and `bbfx62w` (input/add for replacement data).

3. **Retrieve Data (`rtvdta` Subroutine)**:
   - **Check To Carrier ID**: Chains to `bbcaid` using `kltocaid` (`w$co`, `w$cito`) to verify the "To" carrier ID.
     - If found (`*in99 = *off`), the program proceeds (though no specific action is taken, as `w$tonm` assignment is commented out).
     - If not found, no error is raised, as the "To" carrier is assumed to be new (per the program’s context).

4. **Process Window (`prcwdw` Subroutine)**:
   - **Main Loop** (`winagn`):
     - **Display Message Subfile**: If `dspmsg` is on, writes the message subfile (`wrtmsg`); otherwise, clears it (`msgclr`).
     - **Display Window**: Displays the `rplwdw` format using `exfmt`, allowing the user to enter a "From" carrier ID (`w$cifr`).
     - **Clear Messages**: Clears the message subfile if displayed (`clrmsg`).
     - **Clear Error Indicators**: Resets indicators `*in50` to `*in69`.
     - **Process User Input**:
       - **F12 (Exit)**: Sets `winagn` to `*off`, sets `p$flag = '2'` (indicating cancellation), and iterates to exit the loop.
       - **F22 (Confirm)**: Validates input via `winedt`. If no errors (`*in50 = *off`), updates the database via `winupd`, sets `p$flag = '1'` (success), and exits the loop.
       - **Other (e.g., Enter)**: Validates input via `winedt` and redisplays the window if errors exist.

5. **Edit Window Input (`winedt` Subroutine)**:
   - **Allow Blank Entry**: If the "From" carrier ID (`w$cifr`) is blank, no update to `bbfx62w` is performed, and no error is raised.
   - **Validate From Carrier ID**:
     - Chains to `bbcaid` using `klfrcaid` (`w$co`, `w$cifr`).
     - If not found (`*in99 = *on`), clears `w$frnm` (From carrier name), sets error `ERR0000` with message `com(01)` ("Invalid Carrier ID"), sets `*in50` and `*in51`, and calls `addmsg`.
     - If found, moves the carrier name (`cicanm`) to `w$frnm`.
   - **Check Vendor Linkage**:
     - If no prior errors (`*in50 = *off`), checks `apveny` using `klapveny` (`w$co`, `w$cifr`).
     - If no vendor record is found (`*in99 = *on`), sets error `ERR0000` with message `com(02)` ("Code [w$cifr] is linked to a vendor for ARGLMS. Contact IT to convert."), sets `*in50` and `*in51`, and calls `addmsg`.

6. **Update Database from Window Input (`winupd` Subroutine)**:
   - **Check Blank Entry**: If `w$cifr` is blank, no update occurs, and the subroutine exits.
   - **Update bbfx62w**: Clears the `bbfx62wpf` record, sets `w1cifr` (From carrier ID) to `w$cifr`, sets `w1cito` (To carrier ID) to `w$cito`, and writes the record to `bbfx62w`.
   - **Send Confirmation Messages**:
     - Constructs two messages using the `msg` array:
       - First message: "BBFX62W Entry Created. From Carrier [w$cifr] To Carrier [w$cito].) TOUSR(JLBIT)"
       - Second message: "BBFX62W Entry Created. From Carrier [w$cifr] To Carrier [w$cito].) TOUSR(CAPO)"
     - Executes each message using `QCMDEXC` with a length of 120 characters, sending notifications to users `JLBIT` and `CAPO`.

7. **Message Handling**:
   - **Add Message (`addmsg`)**: Sends error messages to the program message queue using `QMHSNDPM` with message ID, file (`GSMSGF`), data, and type (`*DIAG`).
   - **Write Message Subfile (`wrtmsg`)**: Writes the message subfile (`msgctl`) with indicator `*in49`.
   - **Clear Message Subfile (`clrmsg`)**: Clears messages using `QMHRMVPM`. (Saving/restoring `rcdnam` and `pagrrn` is commented out, likely unnecessary for a window-based interface.)

8. **Program Termination**:
   - Closes all files (`close *all`).
   - Sets the last record indicator (`*inlr`) to `*on` and returns.

### Business Rules

The program enforces the following business rules:
1. **Replacement Carrier Capture**:
   - The program captures a "From" carrier ID (`w$cifr`) to pair with the "To" carrier ID (`w$cito`) when creating a new carrier ID, storing the relationship in `bbfx62w`.
   - A blank "From" carrier ID is allowed, in which case no record is written to `bbfx62w`.

2. **Validation**:
   - The "From" carrier ID must exist in `bbcaid` for the given company (`w$co`). If not, an error (`ERR0000`, "Invalid Carrier ID") is displayed.
   - The "From" carrier ID must not be linked to a vendor in `apveny`. If linked, an error (`ERR0000`, "Code [w$cifr] is linked to a vendor for ARGLMS. Contact IT to convert.") is displayed, preventing the update.

3. **User Notification**:
   - Upon successful creation of a `bbfx62w` record, two messages are sent via `QCMDEXC` to users `JLBIT` and `CAPO`, confirming the entry with both carrier IDs.

4. **User Interface**:
   - The window (`rplwdw`) allows the user to enter a "From" carrier ID and confirm with F22 or cancel with F12.
   - F12 sets `p$flag = '2'`, indicating the user chose not to proceed with the replacement.
   - F22 triggers validation and, if successful, updates `bbfx62w` and sets `p$flag = '1'`.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors prevent the database update and keep the window open for correction.
   - Messages are displayed via the message subfile for user feedback.

### Database Tables Used

The program interacts with the following database files:
1. **apveny**: Input-only file for vendor data, overridden to `gapveny` or `zapveny` based on `p$fgrp`. Used to check if the "From" carrier ID is linked to a vendor.
2. **bbcaid**: Input-only file for carrier ID data, overridden to `gbbcaid` or `zbbcaid`. Used to validate the "From" carrier ID.
3. **bbfx62w**: Input/add file for storing replacement carrier relationships, overridden to `gbbfx62w` or `zbbfx62w`. Updated with "From" and "To" carrier IDs.
4. **bb9059d**: Display file (workstation file) containing the `rplwdw` window format and message subfile (`msgctl`) for user interaction.

### External Programs Called

The program calls the following external program:
1. **QCMDEXC**: Executes override commands (`ovrdbf`) for database files and sends confirmation messages to users `JLBIT` and `CAPO`.

### Summary

The `BB9059` program is a specialized module called by `BB905` to capture a "From" carrier ID when creating a new carrier ID, storing the relationship in the `bbfx62w` file. It presents a window (`rplwdw`) for user input, validates the "From" carrier ID against `bbcaid` and `apveny`, and ensures it is valid and not linked to a vendor. Upon successful validation, it writes to `bbfx62w` and notifies users `JLBIT` and `CAPO`. The program supports cancellation (F12) and confirmation (F22), with business rules enforcing data integrity and user notification. File overrides ensure the correct dataset is used, and error messages guide the user through invalid inputs.
